<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>JOAN READS BY FIRELIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>There is no silence so fearful, so breathless,
so searching as the night silence of a wild
country buried five feet deep in snow. For thirty
miles or so, north, south, east, and west of the
small, half-smothered speck of gold in Pierre
Landis&#8217;s cabin window, there lay, on a certain
December night, this silence, bathed in moonlight.
The cold was intense: below the bench
where Pierre&#8217;s homestead lay, there rose from
the twisted, rapid river, a cloud of steam, above
which the hoar-frosted tops of cottonwood trees
were perfectly distinct, trunk, branch, and twig,
against a sky the color of iris petals. The stars
flared brilliantly, hardly dimmed by the full
moon, and over the vast surface of the snow minute
crystals kept up a steady shining of their
own. The range of sharp, wind-scraped mountains,
uplifted fourteen thousand feet, rode across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the country, northeast, southwest, dazzling in
white armor, spears up to the sky, a sight, seen
suddenly, to take the breath, like the crashing
march of archangels militant.
</p>
<p>In the center of this ring of silent crystal,
Pierre Landis&#8217;s logs shut in a little square of
warm and ruddy human darkness. Joan, his wife,
made the heart of this defiant space&mdash;Joan, the
one mind living in this ghostly area of night. She
had put out the lamp, for Pierre, starting townward
two days before, had warned her with a
certain threatening sharpness not to waste oil,
and she lay on the hearth, her rough head almost
in the ashes, reading a book by the unsteady
light of the flames. She followed the printed lines
with a strong, dark forefinger and her lips framed
the words with slow, whispering motions. It was
a long, strong woman&#8217;s body stretched there
across the floor, heavily if not sluggishly built,
dressed rudely in warm stuffs and clumsy boots,
and it was a heavy face, too, unlit from within,
but built on lines of perfect animal beauty. The
head and throat had the massive look of a marble
fragment stained to one even tone and dug up
from Attic earth. And she was reading thus
heavily and slowly, by firelight in the midst of
this tremendous Northern night, Keats&#8217;s version
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
of Boccaccio&#8217;s &#8220;Tale of Isabella and the Pot of
Basil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The story for some reason interested her. She
felt that she could understand the love of young
Lorenzo and of Isabella, the hatred of those two
brothers and Isabella&#8217;s horrible tenderness for
that young murdered head. There were even
things in her own life that she compared with
these; in fact, at every phrase, she stopped, and,
staring ahead, crudely and ignorantly visualized,
after her own experience, what she had just read;
and, in doing so, she pictured her own life.
</p>
<p>Her love and Pierre&#8217;s&mdash;her life before Pierre
came&mdash;to put herself in Isabella&#8217;s place, she
felt back to the days before her love, when she
had lived in a desolation of bleak poverty, up
and away along Lone River in her father&#8217;s shack.
This log house of Pierre&#8217;s was a castle by contrast.
John Carver and his daughter had shared
one room between them; Joan&#8217;s bed curtained
off with gunny-sacking in a corner. She slept on
hides and rolled herself up in old dingy patchwork
quilts and worn blankets. On winter mornings
she would wake covered with the snow that
had sifted in between the ill-matched logs. There
had been a stove, one leg gone and substituted
for by a huge cobblestone; there had been two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
chairs, a long box, a table, shelves&mdash;all rudely
made by John; there had been guns and traps
and snowshoes, hides, skins, the wings of birds, a
couple of fishing-rods&mdash;John made his living by
legal and illegal trapping and killing. He had
looked like a trapped or hunted creature himself,
small, furtive, very dark, with long fingers always
working over his mouth, a great crooked
nose&mdash;a hideous man, surely a hideous father.
He hardly ever spoke, but sometimes, coming
home from the town which he visited several
times a year, but to which he had never taken
Joan, he would sit down over the stove and go
over heavily, for Joan&#8217;s benefit, the story of his
crime and his escape.
</p>
<p>Joan always told herself that she would not
listen, whatever he said she would stop her ears,
but always the story fascinated her, held her,
eyes widened on the figure by the stove. He had
sat huddled in his chair, gnomelike, his face contorting
with the emotions of the story, his own
brilliant eyes fixed on the round, red mouth of
the stove. The reflection of this scarlet circle
was hideously noticeable in his pupils.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s a right to kill his woman if she ain&#8217;t
honest with him,&#8221; so the story began; &#8220;if he
finds out she&#8217;s ben trickin&#8217; of him, playin&#8217; him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
off fer another man. That was yer mother, gel;
she was a bad woman.&#8221; There followed a coarse
and vivid description of her badness and the
manner of it. &#8220;That kinder thing no man can
let pass by in his wife. I found her&#8221;&mdash;again the
rude details of his discovery&mdash;&#8220;an&#8217; I found him,
an&#8217; I let him go fer the white-livered coward he
was, but her I killed. I shot her dead after she&#8217;d
said her prayers an&#8217; asked God&#8217;s mercy on her
soul. Then I walked off, but they kotched me an&#8217;
I was tried. They didn&#8217;t swing me. Out in them
parts they knowed I was in my rights; so the
boys held, but &#8217;twas a life sentence. They tuk
me by rail down to Dawson an&#8217; I give &#8217;em the
slip, handcuffs an&#8217; all. Perhaps &#8217;twas only a
half-hearted chase they made fer me. Some of
them fellers mebbe had wives of their own.&#8221; He
always stopped to laugh at this point. &#8220;An&#8217; I cut
off up country till I come to a smithy at the edge
of a town. I hung round fer a spell till the smith
hed gone off an&#8217; I got into his place an&#8217; rid me of
the handcuffs. &#8217;Twas a job, but I wasn&#8217;t kotched
at it an&#8217; I made myself free.&#8221; Followed the story
of his wanderings and his hardships and his coming
to Lone River and setting out his traps. &#8220;In
them days there weren&#8217;t no law ag&#8217;in&#8217; trappin&#8217;
beaver. A man could make a honest livin&#8217;. Now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
they&#8217;ve tuk an&#8217; made laws ag&#8217;in&#8217; a man&#8217;s bread
an&#8217; butter. I ask ye, if &#8217;t ain&#8217;t wrong on a Tuesday
to trap yer beaver, why, &#8217;t ain&#8217;t wrong the follerin&#8217;
Tuesday. I don&#8217;t see it, jes becos some fellers
back there has made a law ag&#8217;in&#8217; it to suit
theirselves. Anyway, the market fer beaver hides
is still prime. Mebbe I&#8217;ll leave you a fortin, gel.
I&#8217;ve saved you from badness, anyhow. I risked a
lot to go back an&#8217; git you, but I done it. You was
playin&#8217; out in front of yer aunt&#8217;s house an&#8217; I
come fer you. You was a three-year-old an&#8217; a big
youngster. Says I, &#8216;What&#8217;s yer name?&#8217; Says you,
&#8216;Joan Carver&#8217;; an&#8217; I knowed you by yer likeness
to <i>her</i>. By God! I swore I&#8217;d save ye. I tuk you
off with me, though you put up a fight an&#8217; I hed
to use you rough to silence you. &#8216;There ain&#8217;t
a-goin&#8217; to be no man in yer life, Joan Carver,&#8217;
says I; &#8216;you an&#8217; yer big eyes is a-goin&#8217; to be fer
me, to do my work an&#8217; to look after my comforts.
No pretty boys fer you an&#8217; no husbands either
to go a-shootin&#8217; of you down fer yer sins.&#8217;&#8221; He
shivered and shook his head. &#8220;No, here you stays
with yer father an&#8217; grows up a good gel. There
ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to be no man in <i>yer</i> life, Joan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But youth was stronger than the man&#8217;s half-crazy
will, and when she was seventeen, Joan
ran away.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>She found her way easily enough to the town,
for she was wise in the tracks of a wild country,
and John&#8217;s trail townwards, though so rarely
used, was to her eyes plain enough; and very
coolly she walked into the hotel, past the group
of loungers around the stove, and asked at the
desk, where Mrs. Upper sat, if she could get a
job. Mrs. Upper and the loungers stared, for
there were few women in this frontier country
and those few were well known. This great,
strong girl, heavily graceful in her heavily awkward
clothes, bareheaded, shod like a man, her
face and throat purely classic, her eyes gray and
wide and as secret in expression as an untamed
beast&#8217;s&mdash;no one had ever seen the like of her
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yer name?&#8221; asked Mrs. Upper suspiciously.
It was Mormon Day in the town; there
were celebrations and her house was full; she
needed extra hands, but where this wild creature
was concerned she was doubtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan. I&#8217;m John Carver&#8217;s daughter,&#8221; answered
the girl.
</p>
<p>At once comprehension dawned; heads were
nodded, then craned for a better look. Yes, the
town, the whole country even, had heard of John
Carver&#8217;s imprisoned daughter. Sober and drunk,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
he had boasted of her and of how there was to be
&#8220;no man&#8221; in her life. It was like dangling ripe
fruit above the mouths of hungry boys to make
such a boast in such a land. But they were lazy.
It was a country of lazy, slow-thinking, slow-moving,
and slow-talking adventurers&mdash;you
will notice this ponderous, inevitable quality of
rolling stones&mdash;and though men talked with humor
not too fine of &#8220;travelin&#8217; up Lone River for
John&#8217;s gel,&#8221; not a man had got there. Perhaps
the men knew John Carver for a coward, that
most dangerous animal to meet in his own lair.
</p>
<p>Now here stood the &#8220;gel,&#8221; the mysterious
secret goal of desire, a splendid creature, virginal,
savage, as certainly designed for man as Eve.
The men&#8217;s eyes fastened upon her, moved and
dropped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father sent you down here fer a job?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Upper incredulously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I come.&#8221; Joan&#8217;s grave gaze was unchanging.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of it up there. I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; back.
I&#8217;m most eighteen now an&#8217; I kinder want a
change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had not meant to be funny, but a gust of
laughter rattled the room. She shrank back. It
was more terrifying to her than any cruelty she
had fancied meeting her in the town. These were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
the men her father had forbidden, these loud-laughing,
crinkled faces. She had turned to brave
them, a great surge of color in her brows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind the boys, dear,&#8221; spoke Mrs.
Upper. &#8220;They will laff, joke or none. We ain&#8217;t
none of us blamin&#8217; you. It&#8217;s a wonder you ain&#8217;t
run off long afore now. I can give you a job an&#8217;
welcome, but you&#8217;ll be green an&#8217; unhandy. Well,
sir, we kin learn ye. You kin turn yer hand to
chamber-work an&#8217; mebbe help at the table.
Maud will show you. But, Joan, what will dad
do to you? He&#8217;ll be takin&#8217; after you hot-foot, I
reckon, an&#8217; be fer gettin&#8217; you back home as soon
as he can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan did not change her look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be goin&#8217; back with him,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Her slow, deep voice, chest notes of a musical
vibration, stirred the room. The men were hers
and gruffly said so. A sudden warmth enveloped
her from heart to foot. She followed Mrs. Upper
to the initiation in her service, clothed for the
first time in human sympathies.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>PIERRE LAYS HIS HAND ON A HEART</h3>
</div>

<p>Maud Upper was the first girl of her own
age that Joan had ever seen. Joan went in
terror of her and Maud knew this and enjoyed
her ascendancy over an untamed creature twice
her size. There was the crack of a lion-tamer&#8217;s
whip in the tone of her instructions. That was
after a day or two. At first Maud had been horribly
afraid of Joan. &#8220;A wild thing like her, livin&#8217;
off there in the hills with that man, why, ma,
there&#8217;s no tellin&#8217; what she might be doin&#8217; to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t hurt ye,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Upper,
who had lived in the wilds herself, having been
a frontierman&#8217;s wife before the days even of this
frontier town and having married the hotel-keeper
as a second venture. She knew that civilization&mdash;this
rude place being civilization to
Joan&mdash;would cow the girl and she knew that
Maud&#8217;s self-assertive buoyancy would frighten
the soul of her. Maud was large-hipped, high-bosomed,
with a small, round waist much compressed.
She carried her head, with its waved
brown hair, very high, and shot blue glances
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
down along a short, broad nose. Her mouth was
thin and determined, her color high. She had a
curiously shallow, weak voice that sounded
breathless. She taught Joan impatiently and
laughed loudly but not unkindly at her ways.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, she&#8217;s awkward, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221; she would
say to the men; &#8220;trail like a bull moose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men grinned, but their eyes followed
Joan&#8217;s movements. As a matter of fact, she was
not awkward. Through her clumsy clothes, the
heaviness of her early youth, in spite of all the
fetters of her ignorance, her wonderful long bones
and her wonderful strength asserted themselves.
And she never hurried. At first this apparent
sluggishness infuriated Maud. &#8220;Get a gait on ye,
Joan Carver!&#8221; she would scream above the din
of the rough meals, but soon she found that
Joan&#8217;s slow movements accomplished a tremendous
amount of work in an amazingly short time.
There was no pause in the girl&#8217;s activity. She
poured out her strength as a python pours his,
noiselessly, evenly, steadily, no haste, no waste.
And the men&#8217;s eyes brooded upon her.
</p>
<p>If Joan had stayed long at Mrs. Upper&#8217;s, she
would have begun inevitably to model herself on
Maud, who was, in her eyes, a marvelous thing
of beauty. But, just a week after her arrival,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
there came to the inn Pierre Landis and for Joan
began the strange and terrible history of love.
</p>
<p>In the lives of most women, of the vast majority,
the clatter and clash of housewifery prelude
and postlude the spring song of their years. And
the rattle of dishes, of busy knives and forks, the
quick tapping of Maud&#8217;s attendant feet, the
sound of young and ravenous jaws at work: these
sounds were in Joan&#8217;s bewildered ears, and the
sights which they accompanied in her bewildered
eyes, just before she heard Pierre&#8217;s voice, just
before she saw his face.
</p>
<p>It was dinner hour at the hotel, an hour most
dreadful to Joan because of the hurry, the
strangeness, and the crowd, because of the responsibility
of her work, but chiefly because at
that hour she expected the appearance of her
father. Her eyes were often on the door. It opened
to admit the young men, the riders and ranchers
who hung up their hats, swaggered with a little
jingle of spurs to their chairs; clean-faced, clean-handed,
wet-haired, murmuring low-voiced courtesies,&mdash;&#8220;Pass
me the gravy, please,&#8221; &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t be carin&#8217; fer any, thank you,&#8221;&mdash;and
lifting to the faces of waiting girls now and again
their strange, young, brooding eyes, bold, laughing,
and afraid, hungry, pathetic, arrogant, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the eyes of young men are, tameless and untamable,
but full of the pathos of the untamed.
Joan&#8217;s heart shook a little under their looks, but
when Pierre lifted his eyes to her, her heart stood
still. She had not seen them following her progress
around the room. He had come in late, and
finding no place at the long, central table sat
apart at a smaller one under a high, uncurtained
window. By the time she met his eyes they were
charged with light; smoky-blue eyes they were,
the iris heavily ringed with black, the pupils
dilated a little. For the first time it occurred to
Joan, looking down with a still heart into his
eyes, that a man might be beautiful. The blood
came up from her heart to her face. Her eyes
struggled away from his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yer name, gel?&#8221; murmured Pierre.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan Carver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You run away from home?&#8221; He too had
heard of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will your father be takin&#8217; you back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be goin&#8217; with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was about to pass on. Pierre cast a swift
look about the table&mdash;bent heads and busy
hands, eyes cast down, ears, he knew, alert. It
was a land of few women and of many men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
He must leave in the morning early and for
months he would not be back. He put out a long,
hard hand, caught Joan&#8217;s wrist and gave it a
queer, urgent shake, the gesture of an impatient
and beseeching child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be comin&#8217; home with me, gel?&#8221;
asked Pierre hurriedly.
</p>
<p>She looked at him, her lips apart, and she
shook her head.
</p>
<p>Maud&#8217;s voice screamed at her from the kitchen
door. Pierre let her go. She went on, very white.
</p>
<p>She did not sleep at all that night. Her father&#8217;s
face, Pierre&#8217;s face, looked at her. In the morning
Pierre would be gone. She had heard Maud say
that the &#8220;queer Landis feller would be makin&#8217;
tracks back to that ranch of his acrost the river.&#8221;
Yes, he would be gone. She might have been going
with him. She felt the urgent pressure of his hand
on her arm, in her heart. It shook her with such
a longing for love, for all the unknown largesse
of love, that she cried. The next morning, pale,
she came down and went about her work. Pierre
was not at breakfast, and she felt a sinking of
heart, though she had not known that she had
built upon seeing him again. Then, as she stepped
out at the back to empty a bucket, there he
was!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Not even the beauty of dawn could lend mystery
to the hideous, littered yard, untidy as the
yards of frontier towns invariably are, to the
board fence, to the trampled half-acre of dirt,
known as &#8220;The Square,&#8221; and to the ugly frame
buildings straggled about it; but it could and did
give an unearthly look of blessedness to the bare,
gray-brown buttes that ringed the town and a
glory to the sky, while upon Pierre, waiting at
his pony&#8217;s head, it shed a magical and tender
light. He was dressed in his cowboy&#8217;s best, a
white silk handkerchief knotted under his chin,
leather &#8220;chaps,&#8221; bright spurs, a sombrero on his
head. His face was grave, excited, wistful. At
sight of Joan, he moved forward, the pony trailing
after him at the full length of its reins; and,
stopping before her, Pierre took off the sombrero,
slowly stripped the gauntlet from his right hand,
and, pressing both hat and glove against his hip
with the left hand, held out the free, clean palm
to Joan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said he, &#8220;unless&mdash;you&#8217;ll be
comin&#8217; with me after all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan felt again that rush of fire to her brows.
She took his hand and her fingers closed around
it like the frightened, lonely fingers of a little girl.
She came near to him and looked up.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; with you, Pierre,&#8221; she said,
just above her breath.
</p>
<p>He shot up a full inch, stiffened, searched her
with smouldering eyes, then held her hard against
him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not be sorry, Joan Carver,&#8221; said
he gently and put her away from him. Then, unsmiling,
he bade her go in and get her belongings
while he got her a horse and told his news to
Mrs. Upper.
</p>
<p>That ride was dreamlike to Joan. Pierre put
her in her saddle and she rode after him across
the Square and along a road flanked by the ugly
houses of the town.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we a-goin&#8217;?&#8221; she asked him timidly.
</p>
<p>He stopped at that, turned, and, resting his
hand on the cantle of his saddle, smiled at her
for the first time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you savvy the answer to that question,
Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shook her head.
</p>
<p>The smile faded. &#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be married,&#8221;
said he sternly, and they rode on.
</p>
<p>They were married by the justice, a pleasant,
silent fellow, who with Western courtesy, asked
no more questions than were absolutely needful,
and in fifteen minutes Joan mounted her horse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
again, a ring on the third finger of her left
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Pierre, standing at her stirrup,
his shining, smoke-blue eyes lifted to her, his
hand on her boot, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217; some things&mdash;some
clothes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joan. &#8220;Maud went with me an&#8217;
helped me buy things with my pay just yesterday.
I won&#8217;t be needin&#8217; anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We&#8217;re off, then!&#8221; And
he flung himself with a sudden wild, boyish
&#8220;Whoopee!&#8221; on his pony, gave a clip to Joan&#8217;s
horse and his own, and away they galloped, a
pair of young, wild things, out from the town
through a straggling street to where the road
boldly stretched itself toward a great land of
sagebrush, of buttes humping their backs against
the brilliant sky. Down the valley they rode,
trotting, walking, galloping, till, turning westward,
they mounted a sharp slope and came
up above the plain. Below, in the heart of the
long, narrow valley, the river coiled and wandered,
divided and came together again into a
swift stream, amongst aspen islands and willow
swamps. Beyond this strange, lonely river-bed,
the cottonwoods began, and, above them, the
pine forests massed themselves and strode up the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
foothills of the gigantic range, that range of iron
rocks, sharp, thin, and brittle where they scraped
the sky.
</p>
<p>At the top of the hill, Pierre put out his hand
and pulled Joan&#8217;s rein, drawing her to a stop
beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over yonder&#8217;s my ranch,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>Joan looked. There was not a sign of house or
clearing, but she followed his gesture and nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the mountains?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the foot of Thunder Cañon. You can see a
gap in the pines. There&#8217;s a waterfall just above&mdash;that
white streak. Now you&#8217;ve got it. Where
you come from &#8217;s to the south, away yonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan would not turn her head. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly tears rushed to her eyes. She had a
moment of unbearable longing and regret. Pierre
said nothing; he was not watching her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said he, &#8220;or your father will be
takin&#8217; after us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They rode at a gallop down the hill.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>TWO PICTURES IN THE FIRE</h3>
</div>

<p>The period which followed had a quality
of breathless, almost unearthly happiness.
They were young, savage, simple, and their love,
unanalyzed, was as joyous as the loves of animals:
joyous with that clear gravity characteristic
of the boy and girl. Pierre had been terribly
alone before Joan came, and the building-up of
his ranch had occupied his mind day and night
except, now and again, for dreams. Yet he was
of a passionate nature. Joan felt in him sometimes
a savage possibility of violence. Two incidents
of this time blazed themselves especially
on her memory: the one, her father&#8217;s visit, the
other, an irrelevant enough picture until after
events threw back a glare upon it.
</p>
<p>They had been at Pierre&#8217;s ranch for a fortnight
before John Carver found them. Then,
one morning, as Pierre opened the door to go
out to work, Joan saw a thin, red pony tied to
the fence and a small figure walking toward the
cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pierre, it&#8217;s Father!&#8221; she said. And Pierre
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
stopped in his tracks, drew himself up and waited,
hands on his cartridge belt.
</p>
<p>How mean and old and furtive her father
looked in contrast to this beautiful young husband!
Joan was entirely unafraid. She leaned
against the side of the door and watched, as
silent and unconsulted as any squaw, while the
two men settled their property rights in her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve took my gel,&#8221; said John Carver,
stopping a foot or two in front of Pierre, his eyes
shifting up and down, one long hand fingering his
lips.
</p>
<p>Pierre answered courteously. &#8220;Some man was
bound to hev her, Mr. Carver, soon or late. You
can&#8217;t set your face ag&#8217;in&#8217; the laws of natur&#8217;. Will
you be steppin&#8217; in? Joan will give you some
breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Carver paid no heed to the invitation. &#8220;Hev
you married her?&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>The blood rose to Pierre&#8217;s brown face. &#8220;Sure I
hev.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, you hev married the darter of
a &mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Carver used a brutal word. &#8220;Look out
fer her. If you see her eyes lookin&#8217; an&#8217; lookin&#8217; at
another man, you kin know what&#8217;s to come.&#8221;
Pierre was white. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done with her. She kin
never come to me fer bite or bed. Shoot her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
if you hev to, Pierre Landis, but when she&#8217;s
kotched at her mother&#8217;s game, don&#8217;t send her
back to me. That&#8217;s all I come to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned with limber agility and went back
to his horse. He was on it and off, galloping
madly across the sagebrush flat. Pierre turned
and walked into the house past Joan without a
word.
</p>
<p>She still leaned against the door, but her head
was bent.
</p>
<p>Presently she went about her housework.
Every now and then she shot a wistful look at
Pierre. All morning long, he sat there, his hands
hanging between his knees, his eyes full of a
brooding trouble. At noon he shook his head,
got up, and, still without word or caress, he
strode out and did not come back till dark. Joan
suffered heartache and terror. When he came, she
ran into his arms. He kissed her, seemed quite
himself again, and the strange interview was
never mentioned by either of them. They were
silent people, given to feelings and to action
rather than to thoughts and words.
</p>
<p>The other memory was of a certain sunset hour
when she came at Pierre&#8217;s call out to the shed
he had built at one side of their cabin. Its open
side faced the west, and, as Joan came, her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
shadow went before her and fell across Pierre at
work. The flame of the west gave a weird pallor
to the flames over which he bent. He was whistling,
and hammering at a long piece of iron.
Joan came and stood beside him.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he straightened up and held in the
air a bar of metal, the shaped end white hot.
Joan blinked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our brand, gel,&#8221; said Pierre. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you fergit it. When I&#8217;ve made my fortune there&#8217;ll
be stock all over the country marked with them
two bars. That&#8217;ll be famous&mdash;the Two-Bar
Brand. Don&#8217;t you fergit it, Joan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he brought the white iron close so that
she felt its heat on her face and drew back,
flinching. He laughed, let it fall, and kissed her.
Joan was very glad and proud.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE SIN-BUSTER</h3>
</div>

<p>In the fall, when the whole country had turned
to a great cup of gold, purple-rimmed under
the sky, Pierre went out into the hills after his
winter meat. Joan was left alone. She spent her
time cleaning and arranging the two-room cabin,
and tidying up outdoors, and in &#8220;grubbing sagebrush,&#8221;
a gigantic task, for the one hundred and
fifty acres of Pierre&#8217;s homestead were covered
for the most part by the sturdy, spicy growth,
and every bush had to be dug out and burnt to
clear the way for ploughing and planting. Joan
worked with the deliberateness and intentness
of a man. She enjoyed the wholesome drudgery.
She was proud every sundown of the little clearing
she had made, and stood, tired and content,
to watch the piled brush burn, sending up aromatic
smoke and curious, dull flames very high
into the still air.
</p>
<p>She was so standing, hands folded on her rake,
when, on the other side of her conflagration, she
perceived a man. He was steadily regarding her,
and when her eyes fell upon him, he smiled and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
stepped forward&mdash;a tall, broad, very fair young
man in a shooting coat, khaki riding-breeches,
and puttees. He had a wide brow, clear, blue
eyes and an eager, sensitive, clean-shaven mouth
and chin. He held out a big white hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Landis,&#8221; he said, in a crisp voice of an
accent and finish strange to the girl &#8220;I wonder if
you and your husband can put me up for the
night. I&#8217;m Frank Holliwell. I&#8217;m on a round of
parish visits, and, as my parish is about sixty
miles square, my poor old pony has gone lame.
I know you are not my parishioners, though, no
doubt, you should be, but I&#8217;m going to lay claim
to your hospitality, for all that, if I may?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan had moved her rake into the grasp of her
left hand and had taken the proffered palm into
her other, all warm and fragrantly stained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the new sin-buster, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; she
asked gravely.
</p>
<p>The young man opened his blue and friendly
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s what I am, eh? That&#8217;s a new one
to me. Yes. I suppose I am. It&#8217;s rather a fine
name to go by&mdash;sin-buster,&#8221; and he laughed
very low and very amusedly.
</p>
<p>Joan looked him over and slowly smiled. &#8220;You
look like you could bust anything you&#8217;d a mind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
to,&#8221; she said, and led the way toward the house,
her rake across her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pierre,&#8221; she told him when they were in the
shining, clean log house, &#8220;is off in the hills after
his elk, but I can make you up a bed in the
settin&#8217;-room an&#8217; serve you a supper an&#8217; welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks,&#8221; he rather doubtfully accepted.
</p>
<p>Evidently he did not know the ways and proprieties
of this new &#8220;parish&#8221; of his. But Joan
seemed to take the situation with an enormous
calm impersonality. He modeled his manner upon
hers. They sat at the table together, Joan silent,
save when he forced her to speak, and entirely
untroubled by her silence, Frank Holliwell eating
heartily, helping her serve, and talking a great
deal. He asked her a great many questions, which
she answered with direct simplicity. By the end
of dish-washing, he had her history and more of
her opinions, probably, than any other creature
she had met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do when Landis is away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, in the evenings, I mean, after work.
Have you books?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joan; &#8220;it&#8217;s right hard labor,
readin&#8217;. Pa learned me my letters an&#8217; I can spell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
out bits from papers an&#8217; advertisements an&#8217; what
not, but I ain&#8217;t never read a book straight out.
I dunno,&#8221; she added presently, &#8220;but as I&#8217;d like
to. Pierre can read,&#8221; she told him proudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d like to.&#8221; He considered her
through the smoke of his pipe. He was sitting by
the hearth now, and she, just through with clearing
up, stood by the corner of the mantel shelf,
arranging the logs. The firelight danced over her
face, so beautiful, so unlighted from within.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How old are you, Joan Landis?&#8221; he asked
suddenly, using her name without title for the
first time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all? You must read books, you know.
There&#8217;s so much empty space there back of your
brows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up smiling a little, her wide gray
eyes puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Joan. You must read. Will you&mdash;if I
lend you some books?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She considered. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d read
them if you&#8217;d be lendin&#8217; me some. In the evenings
when Pierre&#8217;s away, I&#8217;m right lonesome. I never
was lonesome before, not to know it. It&#8217;ll take
me a long time to read one book, though,&#8221; she
added with an engaging mournfulness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you like&mdash;stories, poetry, magazines?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like real books in stiff covers,&#8221; said Joan,
&#8220;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t like pictures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This surprised the clergyman. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to notion how the folks look myself.
I like pictures of real places, that has got to be
like they are&#8221;&mdash;Joan was talking a great deal
and having trouble with her few simple words&mdash;&#8220;but
I like folks in stories to look like I want &#8217;em
to look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the way the writer describes them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. But you can make up a whole lot on
what the writer describes. If he says &#8216;her eyes is
blue&#8217;; you can see &#8217;em dark blue or light blue or
jest blue. An&#8217; you can see &#8217;em shaped round or
what not, the way you think about folks that
you&#8217;ve heard of an&#8217; have never met.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was extraordinary how this effort at self-expression
excited Joan. She was rarely self-conscious,
but she was usually passive or stolid;
now there was a brilliant flush in her face and her
large eyes deepened and glowed. &#8220;I heerd tell of
you, Mr. Holliwell. Fellers come up here to see
Pierre once in a while an&#8217; one or two of &#8217;em spoke
your name. An&#8217; I kinder figured out you was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
weedy feller, awful solemn-like, an&#8217; of course
you ain&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s real hard for me to notion that
there ain&#8217;t two Mr. Holliwells, you an&#8217; the weedy
sin-buster I&#8217;ve ben picturin&#8217;. Like as not I&#8217;ll get
to thinkin&#8217; of you like two fellers.&#8221; Joan sighed.
&#8220;Seems like when I onct get a notion in my head
it jest sticks there some way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the more wise notions you get the
better. I&#8217;ll ride up here in a couple of weeks&#8217; time
with some books. You may keep them as long as
you will. All winter, if you like. When I can get
up here, we can talk them over, you and Landis
and I. I&#8217;ll try to choose some without pictures.
There will be stories and some poetry, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never read but one pome,&#8221; said Joan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had sat down on the floor by the hearth, her
head thrown back to lean against the cobbles of
the chimney-piece, her knees locked in her hands.
That magnificent long throat of hers ran up to
the black coils of hair which had slipped heavily
down over her ears. The light edged her round
chin and her strongly modeled, regular features;
the full, firm mouth so savagely pure and sensuous
and self-contained. The eyes were mysterious
under their thick lashes and dark, long brows.
This throat and face and these strong hands were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
picked out in their full value of line and texture
from the dark cotton dress she was wearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pome on a card what father had, stuck
ag&#8217;in&#8217; the wall.&#8221; She began to recite, her eyes fixed
upon him with childlike gravity. &#8220;&#8216;He maketh
me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me
beside the still waters.... Yea, though I walk
through the valley of shadows, thou art with me,
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holliwell had taken the pipe from between his
teeth, had straightened up. Her deep voice, the
slight swinging of her body to the rhythm she
had unconsciously given to her lines, the strange
glow in her eyes ... Holliwell wondered why
these things, this brief, sing-song recitation, had
given a light thrill to the surface of his skin, had
sent a tingling to his fingertips. He was the first
person to wonder at that effect of Joan&#8217;s cadenced
music. &#8220;The valley of the shadow&mdash;&#8221; she had
missed a familiar phrase and added value to a
too often repeated line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan! Joan!&#8221; said the &#8220;sin-buster,&#8221; an exclamation
drawn from him on a deep breath,
&#8220;what an extraordinary girl you are! What a
marvelous woman you are going to be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan looked at him in a silence of pure astonishment
and that was the end of their real talk.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>PIERRE BECOMES ALARMED ABOUT HIS PROPERTY</h3>
</div>

<p>The next time Holliwell came, he brought
the books, and, finding Pierre at home, he
sat with his host after supper and talked men&#8217;s
talk of the country; of game, of ranching, a little
gossip, stories of travel, humorous experiences,
and Joan sat in her place, the books in her lap,
looking and listening.
</p>
<p>John Carver had used a phrase, &#8220;When you
see her eyes lookin&#8217; and lookin&#8217; at another
man&mdash;&#8221; and this phrase had stuck in Pierre&#8217;s
sensitive and jealous memory. What Joan felt
for Holliwell was a sort of ignorant and respectful
tenderness, the excitement of an intelligent
child first moved to a knowledge of its own intelligence;
the gratitude of savage loneliness toward
the beautiful feet of exploration. A consciousness
of her clean mind, a consciousness of her young,
untamed spirit, had come slowly to life in her
since her talk with Holliwell. Joan was peculiarly
a woman&mdash;that is, the passive and receptive
being. Pierre had laid his hand on her heart and
she had followed him; now this young parson
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
had put a curious finger on her brain, it followed
him. Her husband saw the admiration, the gratitude,
the tender excitement in her frank eyes,
and the poison seed sown by John Carver&#8217;s hand
shot out roots and tiny, deadly branches.
</p>
<p>But Joan and Holliwell were unaware. Pierre
smoked rapidly, rolling cigarette after cigarette;
he listened with a courteous air, he told stories
in his soft, slow voice; once he went out to bring
in a fresh log and, coming back on noiseless feet,
saw Joan and her instructor bent over one of the
books and Joan&#8217;s face was almost that of a
stranger, so eager, so flushed, with sparkles in
the usually still, gray eyes.
</p>
<p>It was not till a week or two after this second
visit from the clergyman that Pierre&#8217;s smouldering
jealousy broke into flame. After clearing away
the supper things with an absent air of eager
expectation, Joan would dry her hands on her
apron, and, taking down one of her books from
their place in a shelf corner, she would draw her
chair close to the lamp and begin to read, forgetful
of Pierre. These had been the happiest hours
for him; he would tell Joan about his day&#8217;s work,
about his plans, about his past life; wonderful it
was to him, after his loneliness, that she should
be sitting there drinking in every word and loving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
him with her dumb, wild eyes. Now, there
was no talk and no listening. Joan&#8217;s absorbed
face was turned from him and bent over her
book, her lips moved, she would stop and stare
before her. After a long while, he would get up
and go to bed, but she would stay with her books
till a restless movement from him would make
her aware of the lamplight shining wakefulness
upon him through the chinks in the partition
wall. Then she would get up reluctantly, sighing,
and come to bed.
</p>
<p>For ten evenings this went on, Pierre&#8217;s heart
slowly heating itself, until, all at once, the flame
leaped.
</p>
<p>Joan had untied her apron and reached up for
her book. Pierre had been waiting, hoping that
of her free will she might prefer his company to
the &#8220;parson feller&#8217;s&#8221;&mdash;for in his ignorance those
books were jealously personified&mdash;but, without
a glance in his direction, she had turned as usual
to the shelf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You goin&#8217; to read?&#8221; asked Pierre hoarsely.
It was a painful effort to speak.
</p>
<p>She turned with a childish look of astonishment.
&#8220;Yes, Pierre.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood up with one of his lithe, swift movements,
all in one rippling piece. &#8220;By God, you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
not, though!&#8221; said he, strode over to her, snatched
the volume from her, threw it back into its place,
and pointed her to her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You set down an&#8217; give heed to me fer a
change, Joan Carver,&#8221; he said, his smoke-colored
eyes smouldering. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t fetch you up here to
read parsons&#8217; books an&#8217; waste oil. I fetched you
up here&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221; He stopped, choked with a sudden,
enormous hurt tenderness and sat down and
fell to smoking and staring, hot-eyed, into the
fire.
</p>
<p>And Joan sat silent in her place, puzzled, wistful,
wounded, her idle hands folded, looking at
him for a while, then absently before her, and
he knew that her mind was busy again with the
preacher feller&#8217;s books. If he had known better
how to explain his heart, if she had known how
to show him the impersonal eagerness of her
awakening mind&mdash;! But, savage and silent, they
sat there, loving each other, hurt, but locked
each into his own impenetrable life.
</p>
<p>After that, Joan changed the hours of her study
and neglected housework and sagebrush-grubbing,
but, nonetheless, were Pierre&#8217;s evenings
spoiled. Perfection of intercourse is the most
perishable of all life&#8217;s commodities. Now, when
he talked, he could not escape the consciousness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
of having constrained his audience; she could
not escape her knowledge of his jealousy, the
remembrance of his mysterious outbreak, the
irrepressible tug of the story she was reading. So
it went on till snow came and they were shut in,
man and wife, with only each other to watch, a
tremendous test of good-fellowship. This searching
intimacy came at a bad time, just after Holliwell&#8217;s
third visit when he had brought a fresh
supply of books.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s poetry this time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Get
Pierre to read it aloud to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The suggestion was met by a rude laugh from
Pierre.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be wastin&#8217; my time,&#8221; he jeered.
</p>
<p>It was the first rift in his courtesy. Holliwell
looked up in sharp surprise. He saw a flash of the
truth, a little wriggle of the green serpent in
Pierre&#8217;s eyes before they fell. He flushed and
glanced at Joan. She stood by the table in the
circle of lamplight, looking over the new books,
but in her eagerness there was less simplicity.
She wore an almost timorous air, accepted his
remarks in silence, shot doubtful looks at Pierre
before she answered questions, was an entirely
different Joan. Now Holliwell was angry and he
stiffened toward his host and hostess, dropped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
all his talk about the books and smoked haughtily.
He was young and over-sensitive, no more
master of himself in this instance than Pierre
and Joan. But before he left after supper, refusing
a bed, though Pierre conquered his dislike
sufficiently to urge it, Holliwell had a moment
with Joan. It was very touching. He would tell
about it afterwards, but, for a long time, he could
not bear to remember it.
</p>
<p>She tried to return his books, coming with her
arms full of them and lifting up eyes that were
almost tragic with renunciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be takin&#8217; the time to read them, Mr.
Holliwell,&#8221; she said, that extraordinary, over-expressive
voice of hers running an octave of
regret; &#8220;an&#8217; someway Pierre don&#8217;t like that I
should spend my evenin&#8217;s on them. Seems like
he thinks I was settin&#8217; myself up to be knowin&#8217;
more than him.&#8221; She laughed ruefully. &#8220;Me&mdash;knowin&#8217;
more&#8217;n Pierre! It&#8217;s laughable. But anyways
I don&#8217;t want him to be thinkin&#8217; that. So
take the books, please. I like them.&#8221; She paused.
&#8220;I love them,&#8221; she said hungrily and, blinking,
thrust them into his hands.
</p>
<p>He put them down on the table. &#8220;You&#8217;re
wrong, Joan,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t
give in to such a foolish idea. You have rights of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
your own, a life of your own. Pierre mustn&#8217;t
stand in the way of your learning. You mustn&#8217;t
let him. I&#8217;ll speak to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Some intuition warned her of the
danger in his doing this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, keep your books and talk to
Pierre about them. Try to persuade him to read
aloud to you. I shan&#8217;t be back now till spring,
but I want you to read this winter, read all the
stuff that&#8217;s there. Come, Joan, to please me,&#8221;
and he smiled coaxingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afeared of Pierre,&#8221; said Joan slowly.
Her pride was stung by the suggestion. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep
the books.&#8221; She sighed. &#8220;Good-bye. When I see
you in the spring, I&#8217;ll be a right learned school-marm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She held out her hand and he took and held it,
pressing it in his own. He felt troubled about her,
unwilling to leave her in the snowbound wilderness
with that young savage of the smouldering
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Pierre behind him. His soft
voice had a click.
</p>
<p>Holliwell turned to him. &#8220;Good-bye, Landis.
I shan&#8217;t see either of you till the spring. I wish
you a good winter and I hope&mdash;&#8221; He broke off
and held out his hand. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
pretty far out of every one&#8217;s way here. Be good
to each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn your interference!&#8221; said Pierre&#8217;s eyes,
but he took the hand and even escorted Holliwell
to his horse.
</p>
<p>Snow came early and deep that winter. It fell
for long, gray days and nights, and then it came
in hurricanes of drift, wrapping the cabin in
swirling white till only one window peered out
and one gabled corner cocked itself above the
crust. Pierre had cut and stacked his winter
wood; he had sent his cows to a richer man&#8217;s
ranch for winter feeding. There was very little
for him to do. After he had brought in two buckets
of water from the well and had cut, for the
day&#8217;s consumption, a piece of meat from his elk
hanging outside against the wall, he had only
to sit and smoke, to read old magazines and
papers, and to watch Joan. Then the poisonous
roots of his jealousy struck deep. Always his
brain, unaccustomed to physical idleness, was at
work, falsely interpreting her wistful silence&mdash;she
was thinking of the parson, hungry to read
his books, longing for the open season and his
coming again to the ranch.
</p>
<p>In December a man came in on snowshoes
bringing &#8220;the mail&#8221;&mdash;one letter for Pierre, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
communication which brought heat to his face.
The Forest Service threatened him with a loss of
land; it pointed to some flaw in his title; part of
his property, the most valuable part, had not
yet been surveyed.... Pierre looked up with
set jaws, every fighting instinct sharpened to
hold what was his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hev put in two years&#8217; hard work on them
acres,&#8221; he told his visitor, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m not plannin&#8217;
to give them over to the first fool favored by the
Service. My title is as clean as my hand. It&#8217;ll
take more&#8217;n thievery an&#8217; more&#8217;n spite to take it
away from me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You better go to Robinson,&#8221; advised the
bearer of the letter; &#8220;can&#8217;t get after them fellers
too soon. It&#8217;s a country where you can easy come
by what you want, but where it ain&#8217;t so easy to
hold on to it. If it ain&#8217;t yer land, it&#8217;s yer hosses;
if it ain&#8217;t yer hosses, it&#8217;s yer wife.&#8221; He looked at
Joan and laughed.
</p>
<p>Pierre went white and dumb; the chance shot
had inflamed his wound.
</p>
<p>He strapped on his snowshoes and bade a grim
good-bye to Joan, after the man had left. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you be wastin&#8217; oil while I&#8217;m away,&#8221; he told her
sharply, standing in the doorway, his head level
with the steep wall of snow behind him, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
gave her a threatening look so that the tenderness
in her heart was frozen.
</p>
<p>After he had gone, &#8220;Pierre, say a real good-bye,
say good-bye,&#8221; she whispered. Her face
cramped and tears came.
</p>
<p>She heard his steps lightly crunching across
the hard, bright surface of the snow, they entered
into the terrible frozen silence. Then she turned
from the door, dried her eyes with her sleeve like
a little village girl, and ran across the room to a
certain shelf. Pierre would be gone a week. She
would not waste oil, but she would read. It was
with the appetite of a starved creature that she
fell upon her books.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>PIERRE TAKES STEPS TO PRESERVE HIS PROPERTY</h3>
</div>

<p>A log fell forward and Joan lifted her head.
She had not come to an end of Isabella&#8217;s
tragedy nor of her own memories, but something
other than the falling log had startled her; a light,
crunching step upon the snow.
</p>
<p>She looked toward the window. For an instant
the room was almost dark and the white night
peered in at her, its gigantic snow-peaks pressing
against the long, horizontal window panes, and
in that instant she saw a face. The fire started up
again, the white night dropped away, the face
shone close a moment longer, then it too disappeared.
Joan came to her feet with pounding
pulses. It had been Pierre&#8217;s face, but at the same
time, the face of a stranger. He had come back
five days too soon and something terrible had
happened. Surely his chancing to see her with
her book would not make him look like that.
Besides, she was not wasting oil. She had stood
up, but at first she was incapable of moving forward.
For the first time in her life she knew the
paralysis of unreasoning fear. Then the door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
opened and Pierre came in out of the crystal
night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought you back so soon?&#8221; asked
Joan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too soon fer you, eh?&#8221; He strode over to the
hearth where she had lain, took up the book,
struck it with his hand as though it had been a
hated face, and flung it into the fire. &#8220;I seen you
through the window,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So you been
happy readin&#8217; while I been away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you supper. I&#8217;ll light the lamp,&#8221; Joan
stammered.
</p>
<p>Pierre&#8217;s face was pale, his black hair lay in wet
streaks on his temples. He must have traveled
at furious speed through the bitter cold to be in
such a sweat. There was a mysterious, controlled
disorder in his look and there arose from him the
odor of strong drink. But he was steady and sure
in all his movements and his eyes were deadly
cool and reasonable&mdash;only it was the reasonableness
of insanity, reasonableness based on the
wildest premises of unreason.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want no supper, nor no light,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Firelight&#8217;s enough fer you to read parsons&#8217;
books by, it&#8217;s enough fer me to do what I oughter
done long afore to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood in the middle of the small, log-walled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
room, arrested in the act of lighting a match, and
stared at him with troubled eyes. She was no
longer afraid. After all, strange as he looked,
more strangely as he talked, he was her Pierre,
her man. The confidence of her heart had not
been seriously shaken by his coldness and his
moods during this winter. There had been times
of fierce, possessive tenderness. She was his own
woman, his property; at this low counting did
she rate herself. A sane man does no injury to his
own possessions. And Pierre, of course, was sane.
He was tired, angry, he had been drinking&mdash;her
ignorance, her inexperience led her to put little
emphasis on the effects of the poison sold at the
town saloon. When he was warm and fed and
rested, he would be quite himself again. She
went about preparing a meal in spite of his
words.
</p>
<p>He did not seem to notice this. He had taken
his eyes from her at last and was busy with the
fire. She, too, busy and reassured by the familiar
occupation, ceased to watch him. Her pulses
were quiet now. She was even beginning to be
glad of his return. Why had she been so frightened?
Of course, after such a terrible journey
alone in the bitter cold, he would look strange.
Her father, when he came back smelling of liquor,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
had always been more than usually morose and
unlike his every-day self. He would sit over the
stove and tell her the story of his crime. They
were horrible home-comings, horrible evenings,
but the next morning they would seem like
dreams. To-morrow this strangeness of Pierre&#8217;s
would be mistlike and unreal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen your sin-buster in town,&#8221; said Pierre.
He was squatting on his heels over the fire which
he had built up to a great blaze and glow and he
spoke in a queer sing-song tone through his teeth.
&#8220;He asked after you real kind. He wanted to
know how you was gettin&#8217; on with the edication
he&#8217;s ben handin&#8217; out to you. I tell him that you
was right satisfied with me an&#8217; my ways an&#8217; hed
quit his books. I didn&#8217;t know as you was hevin&#8217;
such a good time durin&#8217; my absence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan was cruelly hurt. His words seemed to
fall heavily upon her heart. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t hevin&#8217; a
good time. I was missin&#8217; you, Pierre,&#8221; said she
in a low tremolo of grieving music. &#8220;Them books,
they seemed like they was all the company I
hed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You looked like you was missin&#8217; me,&#8221; he
sneered. &#8220;The sin-buster an&#8217; I had words about
you, Joan. Yes&#8217;m, he give me quite a line of
preachin&#8217; about you, Joan, as how you hed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
oughter develop yer own life in yer own way&mdash;along
the lines laid out by him. I told him as
how I knowed best what was right an&#8217; fittin&#8217; fer
my own wife; as how, with a mother like your&#8217;n
you needed watchin&#8217; more&#8217;n learnin&#8217;; as how you
belonged to me an&#8217; not to him. An&#8217;, says he, &#8216;She
don&#8217;t belong to any man, Pierre Landis,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;neither to you nor to me. She belongs to her
own self.&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217;ll see that she belongs to me,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;I&#8217;ll fix her so she&#8217;ll know it an&#8217; every other
feller will.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that he turned from the fire and straightened
to his feet.
</p>
<p>Joan moved backward slowly to the door. He
had made no threatening sign or movement, but
her fear had come overwhelmingly upon her and
every instinct urged her to flight. But before she
touched the handle of the door, he flung himself
with deadly, swift force and silence across the
room and took her in his arms. With all her
wonderful young strength, Joan could not break
away from him. He dragged her back to the
hearth, tied her elbows behind her with the scarf
from his neck, that very scarf he had worn when
the dawn had shed a wistful beauty upon him,
waiting for her on a morning not so very long ago.
Joan went weak.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pierre,&#8221; she cried pitifully, &#8220;what are you
a-goin&#8217; to do to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He roped her to the heavy post of a set of
shelves built against the wall. Then he stood
away, breathing fast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now whose gel are you, Joan Carver?&#8221; he
asked her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;m yours, Pierre,&#8221; she sobbed.
&#8220;You got no need to tie me to make me say that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to tie you to make you do more&#8217;n say
it. I got to make sure you are it. Hell-fire won&#8217;t
take the sureness out of me after this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned her head, all that she could turn.
</p>
<p>He was bending over the fire, and when he
straightened she saw that he held something in
his hand ... a long bar of metal, white at the
shaped end. At once her memory showed her a
broad glow of sunset falling over Pierre at work.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be stock all over the country marked
with them two bars,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;The Two-Bar
Brand, don&#8217;t you fergit it!&#8221; She was not likely
to forget it now.
</p>
<p>She shut her eyes. He stepped close to her and
jerked her blouse down from her shoulder. She
writhed away from him, silent in her rage and
fear and fighting dumbly. She made no appeal.
At that moment her heart was so full of hatred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
that it was hardened to pride. He lifted his brand
and set it against the bare flesh of her shoulder.
</p>
<p>Then terribly she screamed. Again, when he
took the metal away, she screamed. Afterwards
there was a dreadful silence.
</p>
<p>Joan had not lost consciousness. Her healthy
nerves stanchly received the anguish and the
shock, nor did she make any further outcry. She
pressed her forehead against the sharp edge of
the shelf, she drove her nails into her hands, and
at intervals she writhed from head to foot. Circles
of pain spread from the deep burn on her shoulder,
spread and shrank, to spread and shrink
again. The bones of her shoulder and arm ached
terribly; fire still seemed to be eating into her
flesh. The air was full of the smell of scorched
skin so that she tasted it herself. And hotter than
her hurt her heart burned consuming its own
tenderness and love and trust.
</p>
<p>When this pain left her, when she was free of
her bonds, no force nor fear would hold her to
Pierre. She would leave him as she had left her
father. She would go away. There was no place
for her to go to, but what did that matter so long
as she might escape from this horrible place and
this infernal tormentor? She did not look about to
see the actuality of Pierre&#8217;s silence. She thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
that he had dropped the brand and was sitting
near the table with his face hidden. How long
the stillness of pain and fury and horror lasted
there was no one to reckon. It was most startlingly
broken by a voice. &#8220;Who screamed for
help?&#8221; it said, and at the same instant a draught
of icy air smote Joan. The door had opened with
suddenness and violence. With difficulty she
mastered her pain and turned her head.
</p>
<p>Pierre had staggered to his feet. Opposite him,
framed against the open door filled with the wan
whiteness of the snow, stood a spare, tall figure.
The man wore his fur collar turned up about his
chin and ears, his fur cap pulled down about his
brow, a sharp aquiline nose stood out above
frozen mustaches, keen and brilliant eyes searched
the room. He carried his gun across his arm in
readiness, and snuffed the air like a suspicious
hound. Then he advanced a step toward Pierre.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What devil&#8217;s work have you been at?&#8221; said
he, his voice cutting the ear in its sharpness of
astonished rage, and his hand slid down along
the handle of his gun.
</p>
<p>Pierre, watching him like a lynx, side-stepped,
crouched, whipped out his gun, and fired. At
almost the same second the other&#8217;s gun went off.
Pierre dropped.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>This time Joan&#8217;s nerves gave way and the room,
with its smell of scorched flesh, of powder, and
of frost, went out from her horrified senses. For
a moment the stranger&#8217;s stern face and brilliant
eyes made the approaching center of a great
cloud of darkness, then it too went out.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE JUDGMENT OF GOD</h3>
</div>

<p>The man who had entered with such violence
upon so violent a scene, stood waiting till
the smoke of Pierre&#8217;s discharge had cleared away,
then, still holding his gun in readiness, he stepped
across the room and bent over the fallen man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve killed him!&#8221; he said, just above his
breath, and added presently, &#8220;That was the judgment
of God.&#8221; He looked about, taking in every
detail of the scene, the branding iron that had
burnt its mark deep into the boards where Pierre
had thrown it down, the glowing fire heaped high
and blazing dangerously in the small room, the
woman bound and burnt, the white night outside
the uncurtained window.
</p>
<p>Afterwards he went over to the woman, who
drooped in her bonds with head hanging backward
over the wounded shoulder. He untied the
silk scarf and the rope and carried her, still unconscious,
into the bedroom where he laid her
on the bed and bathed her face in water. Joan&#8217;s
crown of hair had fallen about her neck and
temples. Her bared throat and shoulder had the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
firm smoothness of marble, her lifeless face, its
pure, full lips fallen apart, its long lids closed,
black-fringed and black-browed, owing little of
its beauty to color or expression, was at no loss
in this deathlike composure and whiteness. The
man dealt gently with her as though she had
been a child. He found clean rags which he soaked
in oil and placed over her burn, then he drew the
coarse clothing about her and resumed his bathing
of her forehead.
</p>
<p>She gave a moaning sigh, her face contracted
woefully, and she opened her eyes. The man
looked into them as a curious child might look
into an opened door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see what happened?&#8221; he asked her
when she had come fully to herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Joan whispered, her lips shaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve killed the brute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her face became a classic mask of tragedy,
the drawn brows, horrified eyes, and widened
mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pierre? Killed?&#8221; Her voice, hardly more than
a whisper, filled the house with its agony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sorry?&#8221; demanded her rescuer
sternly. &#8220;Was he in the habit of tying you up or
was this&mdash;branding&mdash;a special diversion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan turned her face away, writhed from head
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
to foot, put up her two hands between him and
her agonizing memories.
</p>
<p>The man rose and left her, going softly into
the next room. There he stood in a tense attitude
of thought, sat down presently with his long,
narrow jaw in his hands and stared fixedly at
Pierre. He was evidently trying to fight down the
shock of the spectacle, grimly telling himself to
become used to the fact that here lay the body
of a man that he had killed. In a short time he
seemed to be successful, his face grew calm. He
looked away from Pierre and turned his mind to
the woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; he said presently, in
the tone of a man who has fallen into the habit
of talking aloud to himself. He looked about in a
hesitant, doubtful fashion. &#8220;God!&#8221; he said abruptly
and snapped his fingers and thumb. He
looked angry. Again he bent over Pierre, examined
him with thoroughness and science, his face
becoming more and more calm. At the end he
rose and with an air of authority he went in again
to Joan. She lay with her face turned to the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible for you to stay here,&#8221; said
he in a voice of command. &#8220;You are not fit to
take care of yourself, and I can&#8217;t stay and take
care of you. You must come with me. I think you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
can manage that. Your husband&mdash;if he is your
husband&mdash;is dead. It may or may not be a
matter for sorrow to you, but I should say that it
ought not to be anything but a merciful release.
Women are queer creatures, though.... However,
whether you are in grief or in rejoicing, you
can&#8217;t stay here. By to-morrow or next day you&#8217;ll
need more nursing than you do now. I don&#8217;t want
to take you to a neighbor, even if there was one
near enough, but I&#8217;ll take you with me. Will you
get ready now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His sure, even, commanding voice evidently
had a hypnotizing effect upon the dazed girl.
Slowly, wincing, she stood up, and with his help
gathered together some of her belongings which
he put in the pack he carried on his shoulders.
She wrapped herself in her warmest outdoor
clothing. He then put his hand upon her arm and
drew her toward the door of that outer room.
She followed him blindly with no will of her own,
but, as he stopped to strap on his snowshoes, her
face lightened with pain, and she made as if to
run to Pierre&#8217;s body. He stood before her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
touch him,&#8221; said he, and, turning himself, he
glanced back at Pierre. In that glance he saw one
of the lean, brown hands stir. His face became
suddenly suffused, even his eyes grew shot with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
blood. Standing carefully so as to obstruct her
view, he caught at the corner of an elk hide and
threw it over Pierre. Then he went to Joan, who
stared at him, white and shaking. He put his arm
around her and drew her out, shutting the door
of her home and leaning against it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go back,&#8221; said he gently and reasonably.
&#8220;The man tried to kill you. You can&#8217;t
go back. Surely you meant to go away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joan, &#8220;yes. I did mean to go away.
But&mdash;but it&#8217;s Pierre.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bent and began to strap on her snowshoes.
There was a fighting brilliance in his eyes and a
strange look of hurry about him that had its
effect on Joan. &#8220;It&#8217;s Pierre no longer,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;What can you do for him? What can he do for
you? Be sensible, child. Come. Don&#8217;t waste time.
There will be snow to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In fact it was to-day. The moon had set and a
gray dawn possessed the world. It was not nearly
so cold and the great range had vanished in a
bank of gray-black clouds moving steadily northward
under a damp wind. Joan looked at this one
living creature with wide, fever-brightened eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the man impatiently.
</p>
<p>Joan bent her head and followed him across
the snow.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>DELIRIUM</h3>
</div>

<p>It is not the people that have led still and uneventful
lives who are best prepared for emergencies.
They are not trained to face crises, to
make prompt and just decisions. Joan had made
but two such resolutions in her life; the first
when she had followed Pierre, the second when
she had kept Holliwell&#8217;s books in defiance of
her husband&#8217;s jealousy. The leaving her father
had been the result of long and painful thought.
Now, in a few hours, events had crashed about
her so that her whole life, outer and inner, had
been shattered. Beyond the pain and fever of her
wound there was an utter confusion of her faculties.
Before she fainted she had, indeed, made
a distinct resolve to leave Pierre. It was this
purpose, working subconsciously on her will, as
much as the urgent pressure of the stranger, that
took her past Pierre&#8217;s body out into the dawn
and sent her on that rash journey of hers in the
footsteps of an unknown man. This being seemed
to her then hardly human. Mysteriously he had
stepped in out of the night, mysteriously he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
condemned Pierre, and in self-defense, for Joan
had seen Pierre draw his gun and fire, he had
killed her husband. Now, just as mysteriously,
as inevitably it seemed to her, he took command
of her life. She was a passive, shipwrecked thing&mdash;a
derelict. She had little thought and no care
for her life.
</p>
<p>As the silent day slowly brightened through
its glare of clouds, she plodded on, setting her
snowshoes in the tracks her leader made. The
pain in her shoulder steadily increased, more and
more absorbed her consciousness. She saw little
but the lean, resolute figure that went before her,
turning back now and then with a look and a
smile that were a compelling mixture of encouragement,
pity, and command. She did not know
that they were traveling north and west toward
the wildest and most desolate country, that every
time she set down her foot she set it down farther
from humanity. She began soon to be a little
light-headed and thought that she was following
Pierre.
</p>
<p>At noon they entered the woods, and her guide
came beside her and led her through fallen timber
and past pitfalls of soft snow. Suddenly,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t go no more,&#8221; she sobbed, and stopped,
swaying. At that he took her in his arms and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
carried her a few hundred feet till they entered
a cabin under the shelter of firs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the ranger-station,&#8221; said he; &#8220;the ranger
told me that I could make use of it on my way
back. We can pass the night here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan knew that he had carried her across a
strange room and put her on a strange bed. He
took off her snowshoes, and she lay watching him
light a fire in the cold, clean stove and cook a
meal from supplies left by the owner of the house.
She was trying now to remember who he was,
what had happened, and why she was in such
misery and pain. Sometimes she knew that he
was her father and that she was at home in that
wretched shack up Lone River, and an ineffable
satisfaction would relax her cramped mind; sometimes,
just as clearly, she knew that he was
Pierre who had taken her away to some strange
place, and, in this certainty, she was even more
content. But always the horrible flame on her
shoulder burnt her again to the confusion of half-consciousness.
He wasn&#8217;t John Carver, he wasn&#8217;t
Pierre. Who, in God&#8217;s name, was he? And why
was she here alone with him? She could not frame
a question; she had a fear that, if she began to
speak, she would scream and rave, would tell
impossible, secret, sacred things. So she held
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
herself to silence, to a savage watchfulness, to
a battle with delirium.
</p>
<p>The man brought her a cup of strong coffee
and held up her head so that she could drink it,
but it nauseated her and she thrust it weakly
away, asking for cold water. After she had drunk
this, her mind cleared for an instant and she
tried to stand up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go back to Pierre now,&#8221; she said,
looking about with wild but resolute eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie still,&#8221; said the stranger gently. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not fit to stir. Trust me. It&#8217;s all right. You&#8217;re
quite safe. Get rested and well, then you may go
wherever you like. I want only to help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The reassuring tone, the promising words
coerced her and she dropped back. Presently, in
spite of pain, she slept.
</p>
<p>She woke and slept in fever for many hours,
vaguely aware, at times, that she was traveling.
She felt the motion of a sled under her and knew
that she was lying on the warm hide of some
freshly killed beast and that a blanket and a
canvas covering protected her from a swirl of
snow. Then she thought she heard a voice babbling
queerly and saw a face quite terribly different
from other human faces. The covering was
taken from her, snowflakes touched her cheek,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
a lantern shone in her eyes, and she was lifted
and carried into a warm, pleasant-smelling place
from which were magically and completely banished
all sound and bitterness of storm. She tried
to see where she was, but her eyes looked on incredible
colors and confusions, so she shut them
and passively allowed herself to be handled by
deft hands. She knew only that delicious coolness,
cleanliness, and softness were given to her body,
that the pain in her shoulder was soothed, that
dreamlessly she slept.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>DRIED ROSE-LEAVES</h3>
</div>

<p>The house that Prosper Gael had built for
himself and for the woman whom Joan came
to think of as the &#8220;tall child,&#8221; stood in a cañon, a
deep, secret fold of the hills, where a cliff stood
behind it, and where the pine-needled ground
descended before its door, under the far-flung,
greenish-brown shade of fir boughs, to the lip of
a green lake. Here the highest snow-peak toppled
giddily down and reared giddily up from the
crystal green to the ether blue, firs massed into
the center of the double image. In January, the
lake was a glare of snow, in which the big firs
stood deep, their branches heavily weighted.
Prosper had dug a tunnel from his door through
a big drift which touched his eaves. It was curious
to see Wen Ho come pattering out of this
Northern cave, his yellow, Oriental face and slant
eyes peering past the stalactite icicles as though
they felt their own incongruity almost with a sort
of terror. The interior of the five-room house
gave just such an effect of bizarre and extravagant
contrast; an effect, too, of luxury, though in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
truth it was furnished for the most part with
stuffs and objects picked up at no very great
expense in San Francisco shops. Nevertheless,
there was nothing tawdry and, here and there,
something really precious. Draperies on the
walls, furniture made by Wen Ho and Prosper,
lacquered in black and red, brass and copper,
bright pewter, gay china, some fur rugs, a gorgeous
Oriental lamp, bookcases with volumes of
a sober richness, in fact the costliest and most
laborious of imports to this wilderness, small-paned,
horizontal windows curtained in some
heavy green-gold stuff which slipped along the
black lacquered pole on rings of jade; all these
and a hundred other points of softly brilliant
color gave to the living-room a rare and striking
look, while the bedrooms were matted, daintily
furnished, carefully appointed as for a bride.
Much thought and trouble, much detailed labor,
had gone to the making of this odd nest in a
Wyoming cañon. Whatever one must think of
Prosper Gael, it is difficult to shirk heartache on
his account. A man of his temperament does not
lightly undertake even a companioned isolation
in a winter land. To picture what place of torment
this well-appointed cabin was to him before
he brought to it Joan, as a lonely man brings in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
a wounded bird to nurse and cherish, stretches
the fancy on a rack of varied painfulness.
</p>
<p>On that night, snow was pouring itself down
the narrow cañon in a crowded whirl of dry, clean
flakes. Wen Ho, watchful, for his master was already
a day or so beyond the promised date of
his return, had started a fire on the hearth and
spread a single cover on the table. He had drawn
the green-and-gold curtains as though there had
been anything but whirling whiteness to look in
and stood warming himself with a rubbing of
thin, dry hands before the open blaze. The real
heat of the house, and it was almost unbearably
hot, came from the stoves in kitchen and bedrooms,
but this fire gave its quota of warmth and
more than its quota of that beauty so necessary
to Prosper Gael.
</p>
<p>Wen Ho put his head from one side to the other
and stopped rubbing his hands. He had heard
the packing of snow under webs and runners.
After listening a moment, he nodded to himself,
like a figure in a pantomime, ran into the kitchen,
did something to the stove, then lighted a lantern
and pattered out along the tunnel dodging the
icicle stalactites. Between the firs he stopped and
held his lantern high so that it touched a moving
radius of flakes to silver stars. Back of him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
through the open door streamed the glow of
lamp and fire filling the icicles with blood and
flushing the walls and the roof of the cave.
</p>
<p>Down the cañon Prosper shouted, &#8220;Wen Ho!
Wen Ho!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Chinaman plunged down the trail, packed
below the new-fallen snow by frequent passage,
and presently met the bent figure of his master
pulling and breathing hard. Without speaking,
Wen Ho laid hold of the sled rope and together
the two men tugged up the last steep bit of the
hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Velly heavy load,&#8221; said Wen.
</p>
<p>Prosper&#8217;s eyes, gleaming below the visor of his
cap, smiled half-maliciously upon him. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
deer killed out of season,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and other
cattle&mdash;no maverick either&mdash;fairly marked by
its owner. Lend me a hand and we&#8217;ll unload.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wen showed no astonishment. He removed
the covering and peeped slantwise at the strange
woman who stared at him unseeingly with large,
bright eyes. She closed them, frowning faintly as
though she protested against the intrusion of a
Chinese face into her disturbed mental world.
</p>
<p>The men took her up and carried her into the
house, where they dressed her wound and laid
her with all possible gentleness in one of the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
beds of stripped and lacquered pine that stood in
the bedroom facing the lake. Afterwards they
moved the other bed and Prosper went in to his
meal.
</p>
<p>He was too tired to eat. Soon he pushed his
plate away, turned his chair to face the fire, and,
slipping down to the middle of his spine, stuck out
his lean, long legs, locked his hands back of his
head, let his chin fall, and stared into the flames.
</p>
<p>Wen Ho removed the dishes, glancing often
at his master.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You velly tired?&#8221; he questioned softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was something of a pull in the storm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Velly small deer,&#8221; babbled the Chinaman,
&#8220;velly big lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper smiled a queer smile that sucked in
and down the corners of his mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She come after all?&#8221; asked Wen Ho.
</p>
<p>Prosper&#8217;s smile disappeared; he opened his
eyes and turned a wicked, gleaming look upon
his man. What with the white face and drawn
mouth the look was rather terrible. Wen Ho vanished
with an increase of speed and silence.
</p>
<p>Alone, Prosper twisted himself in his chair till
his head rested on his arms. It was no relaxation
of weariness or grief, but an attitude of cramped
pain. His face, too, was cramped when, a motionless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
hour later, he lifted it again. He got up then,
broken with weariness, and went softly across
the matted hall into the room where Joan slept,
and he stood beside her bed.
</p>
<p>A glow from the stove, and the light shining
through the door, dimly illumined her. She was
sleeping very quietly now; the flush of fever had
left her face and it was clear of pain, quite simple
and sad. Prosper looked at her and looked about
the room as though he felt what he saw to be a
dream. He put his hand on one long strand of
Joan&#8217;s black hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good child!&#8221; And
went out softly, shutting the door.
</p>
<p>In the bedroom where Joan came again to
altered consciousness of life, there stood a blue
china jar of potpourri, rose-leaves dried and
spiced till they stored all the richness of a Southern
summer. Joan&#8217;s first question, strangely
enough, was drawn from her by the persistence
of this vague and pungent sweetness.
</p>
<p>She was lying quietly with closed eyes, Prosper
looking down at her, his finger on her even pulse,
when, without opening her long lids, she asked,
&#8220;What smells so good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper started, drew away his fingers, then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
answered, smiling, &#8220;It&#8217;s a jar of dried rose-leaves.
Wait a moment, I&#8217;ll let you hold it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took the jar from the window sill and carried
it to her.
</p>
<p>She looked at it, took it in her hands, and when
he removed the lid, she stirred the leaves curiously
with her long forefinger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen roses,&#8221; she said, and added,
&#8220;What&#8217;s basil?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper was startled. For an instant all his
suppositions as to Joan were disturbed. &#8220;Basil?
Where did you ever hear of basil?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isabella and Lorenzo,&#8221; murmured Joan, and
her eyes darkened with her memories.
</p>
<p>Prosper found his heart beating faster than
usual. &#8220;Who are you, you strange creature? I
think it&#8217;s time you told me your name. Haven&#8217;t
you any curiosity about me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joan; &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a great deal
about you.&#8221; She wrinkled her wide brows. &#8220;You
must have been out after game, though &#8217;t was
out of season. And you must have heard me
a-cryin&#8217; out an&#8217; come in. That was right courageous,
stranger. I would surely like you to know
why I come away with you,&#8221; she went on, wistful
and weak, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know as how I can
make it plain to you.&#8221; She paused, turning the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
blue jar in her hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re very strange to
me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; yet, someways, you takin&#8217;
care of me so well an&#8217; so&mdash;so awful kind&mdash;&#8221;
her voice gave forth its tremolo of feeling&mdash;&#8220;seems
like I knowed you better than any other
person in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flush came into his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t like you to be thinkin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221; She
stopped, a little breathless.
</p>
<p>He took the jar, sat down on the bed, and laid
a hand firmly over both of hers. &#8220;I &#8216;won&#8217;t be
thinking&#8217; anything,&#8221; he said, &#8220;only what you
would like me to think. Listen&mdash;when a man
finds a wounded bird out in the winter woods,
he&#8217;ll bring it home to care for it. And he &#8216;won&#8217;t
be thinking&#8217; the worse of its helplessness and
tameness. Of course I know&mdash;but tell me your
name, please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan Landis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the name, given painfully, Joan drew a
weighted breath, another, then, pushing herself
up as though oppressed beyond endurance, she
caught at Prosper&#8217;s arm, clenched her fingers
upon it, and bent her black head in a terrible
paroxysm of grief. It was like a tempest. Prosper
thought of storm-driven, rain-wet trees wild in
a wind ... of music, the prelude to &#8220;Fliegende
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Holländer.&#8221; Joan&#8217;s weeping bent and rocked her.
He put his arm about her, tried to soothe her.
At her cry of &#8220;Pierre! Pierre!&#8221; he whitened, but
suddenly she broke from him and threw herself
back amongst the pillows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T was you that killed him,&#8221; she moaned.
&#8220;What hev I to do with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not the last time that bitter exclamation
was to rise between them; more and more fiercely
it came to wring his peace and hers. This time
he bore it with a certain philosophy, calmed her
patiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I help it, Joan?&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;You saw how it was?&#8221; As she grew quieter, he
talked. &#8220;I heard you scream like a person being
tortured to death&mdash;twice&mdash;a gruesome enough
sound, let me tell you, to hear in the dead of a
white, still night. I didn&#8217;t altogether want to
break into your house. I&#8217;ve heard some ugly
stories about men venturing to disturb the work
of murderers. But, you see, Joan, I&#8217;ve a fear of
myself. I&#8217;ve a cruel brain. I can use it on my own
failures. I&#8217;ve been through some self-punishment&mdash;no!
of course, you don&#8217;t understand all
that.... Anyway, I came in, in great fear of
my life, and saw what I saw&mdash;a woman tied up
and devilishly tortured, a man gloating over her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
helplessness. Naturally, before I spoke my mind,
as a man was bound to speak it, under the pain
and fury of such a spectacle, I got ready to defend
myself. Your&mdash;Pierre&#8221;&mdash;there was a biting
contempt in his tone&mdash;&#8220;saw my gesture,
whipped out his gun, and fired. My shot was
half a second later than his. I might more readily
have lost my life than taken his. If he had lived,
Joan, could you have forgiven him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; sobbed Joan; &#8220;I think not.&#8221; She trembled.
&#8220;He said terrible hard words to me. He
didn&#8217;t love me like I loved him. He planned to
put a brand on me so&#8217;s I c&#8217;d be his own like as if
I was a beast belongin&#8217; to him. Mr. Holliwell said
right, I don&#8217;t belong to no man. I belong to my
own self.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The storm had passed into this troubled after-tossing
of thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me about it all?&#8221; asked Prosper.
&#8220;Would it help?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she moaned; &#8220;no, I couldn&#8217;t.
Only&mdash;if I hadn&#8217;t &#8216;a&#8217; left Pierre a-lyin&#8217; there
alone. A dog that had onct loved him wouldn&#8217;t
&#8216;a&#8217; done that.&#8221; She sat up again, white and wild.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I must go back. I must surely go.
I must! Oh, I must!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back thirty miles through wet snow when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
you can&#8217;t walk across the room, Joan?&#8221; He
smiled pityingly.
</p>
<p>Her hands twisting in his, she stared past him,
out through the window, where the still, sunny
day shone blue through shadowy pine branches.
Tears rolled down her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you go back?&#8221; She turned the desolate,
haunted eyes upon him. &#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t you?&mdash;to
do some kindness to him? Can you ever stop
a-thinkin&#8217; of him lyin&#8217; there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper&#8217;s face was hard through its gentleness.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen too many dead men, less deserving
of death. But, hush!&mdash;you lie down and go to
sleep. I&#8217;ll try to manage it. I&#8217;ll try to get back
and show him some kindness, as you say. There!
Will you be a good girl now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She fell back and her eyes shone their gratitude
upon him. &#8220;Oh, you are good!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;When I&#8217;m well&mdash;I&#8217;ll work for you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shook his head, smiled, kissed her hand,
and went out.
</p>
<p>She was entirely exhausted by her emotion, so
that all her memories fell away from her and left
her in a peaceful blankness. She trusted Prosper&#8217;s
word. With every fiber of her heart she trusted
him, as simply, as singly, as foolishly as a child
trusts God.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>PROSPER COMES TO A DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>Perhaps, in spite of his gruesome boast as
to dead men, it was as much to satisfy his
own spirit as to comfort Joan&#8217;s that Prosper
actually did undertake a journey to the cabin
that had belonged to Pierre. It was true that
Prosper had never been able to stop thinking,
not so much of the tall, slim youth lying so still
across the floor, all his beauty and strength
turned to an ashen slackness, as of a brown hand
that stirred. The motion of those fingers groping
for life had continually disturbed him. The man,
to Prosper&#8217;s mind, was an insensate brute, deserving
of death, even of torment, most deserving
of Joan&#8217;s desertion, nevertheless, it was not easy
to harden his nerves against the picture of a man
left, wounded and helpless, to die slowly alone.
Prosper went back expecting to find a dead man,
went back as a murderer visits the scene of his
crime. He dubbed himself more judge than murderer,
but there was a restless misery of the
imagination not to be quieted by names. He went
back stealthily at dusk, choosing a dusk of wind-driven
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
snow so that his tracks vanished as soon
as made. It was very desolate&mdash;the blank surface
of the world with its flying scud, the blank
yellow-gray sky, the range, all iron and white,
the blue-black scars of leafless trees, the green-black
etchings of firs. The wind cut across like a
scythe, sharp, but making no stir above the drift.
It was all dead and dark&mdash;an underground
world which, Prosper felt, never could have seen
the sun, had no memory of sun nor moon nor
stars. The roof of Pierre&#8217;s cabin made a dark
ridge above the snow, veiled in cloudy drift. He
reached it with a cold heart and slid down to its
window, cautiously bending his face near to the
pane. He expected an interior already dark from
the snow piled round the window, so he cupped
his hands about his eyes. At once he let himself
drop out of sight below the sill. There was a living
presence in the house. Prosper had seen a
bright fire, the smoke of which had been hidden
by the snow-spray, a cot was drawn up before the
fire, and a big, fair young man in tweeds whose
face, rosy, sensitive, and quiet, was bent over the
figure on the cot. A pair of large, white hands
were carefully busy.
</p>
<p>Prosper, crouched below the window, considered
what he had seen. It was a week now since
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
he had left Landis for a dying man. This big fellow
in tweeds must have come soon after the
shooting. Evidently he was not caring for a dead
man. The black head on the pillow had moved.
Now there came the sound of speech, just a bass
murmur. This time the black head turned itself
slightly and Prosper saw Pierre&#8217;s face. He had seen
it only twice before; once when it had looked up,
fierce and crazed, at his first entrance into the
house, once again when it lay with lifted chin and
pale lips on the floor. But even after so scarce a
memory, Prosper was startled by the change.
Before, it had been the face of a man beside himself
with drink and the lust of animal power and
cruelty; now it was the wistful face of Pierre,
drawn into a tragic mask like Joan&#8217;s when she
came to herself; a miserably haunted and harrowed
face, hopeless as though it, too, like the
outside world, had lost or had never had a memory
of sun. Evidently he submitted to the dressing
of his wound, but with a shamed and pitiful
look. Prosper&#8217;s whole impression of the man was
changed, and with the change there began something
like a struggle. He was afflicted by a crossing
of purposes and a stumbling of intention.
</p>
<p>He did not care to risk a second look. He crept
away and fled into the windy dusk. He traveled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
with the wind like a blown rag, and, stopping
only for a few hours&#8217; rest at the ranger station,
made the journey home by morning of the second
day. And on the journey he definitely made up
his mind concerning Joan.
</p>
<p>Prosper Gael was a man of deliberate, though
passionate, imagination. He did not often act
upon impulse, though his actions were often those
attempted only by passion-driven or impulsive
folk. Prosper could never plead thoughtlessness.
He justified carefully his every action to himself.
Those were cold, dark hours of deliberation as he
let the wind drive him across the desolate land.
When the wind dropped and a splendid, still
dawn swept up into the clean sky, he was at
peace with his own mind and climbed up the
mountain trail with a half-smile on his face.
</p>
<p>In the dawn, awake on her pillows, Joan was
listening for him, and at the sound of his webs
she sat up, pale to her lips. She did not know
what she feared, but she was filled with dread.
The restful stupor that had followed her storm
of grief had spent itself and she was suffering
again&mdash;waves of longing for Pierre, of hatred
for him, alternately submerged her. All these
bleak, gray hours of wind during which Wen Ho
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
had pattered in and out with meals, with wood
for her stove, with little questions as to her comfort,
she had suffered as people suffer in a dream;
a restless misery like the misery of the pine
branches that leaped up and down before her
window. The stillness of the dawn, with its sound
of nearing steps, gave her a sickness of heart and
brain, so that when Prosper came softly in at her
door she saw him through a mist. He moved
quickly to her side, knelt by her, took her hands.
His touch at all times had a tingling charge of
vitality and will.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been cared for, Joan,&#8221; said Prosper.
&#8220;Some friend of his came and did all that was
left to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some friend?&#8221; In the pale, delicately expanding
light Joan&#8217;s face gleamed between its black
coils of hair with eyes like enchanted tarns. In
fact they had been haunted during his absence
by images to shake her soul. Prosper could see
in them reflections of those terrors that had been
tormenting her. His touch pressed reassurance
upon her, his eyes, his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor child! My dear! I&#8217;m glad I am back
to take care of you! Cry. Let me comfort you.
He has been cared for. He is not lying there
alone. He is dead. Let&#8217;s forgive him, Joan.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
shook her hands a little, urgently, and a most
painful memory of Pierre&#8217;s beseeching grasp
came upon Joan.
</p>
<p>She wrenched away and fell back, quivering,
but she did not cry, only asked in her most moving
voice, &#8220;Who took care of Pierre&mdash;after I
went away and left him dead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper got to his feet and stood with his arms
folded, looking wearily down at her. His mouth
had fallen into rather cynical lines and there were
puckers at the corners of his eyes. &#8220;Oh, a big,
fair young man&mdash;a rosy boy-face, serious-looking,
blue eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan was startled and turned round. &#8220;It was
Mr. Holliwell,&#8221; she said, in a wondering tone.
&#8220;Did you talk with him? Did you tell him&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Hardly.&#8221; Prosper shook his head. &#8220;I
found out what he had done for your Pierre without
asking unnecessary questions. I saw him, but
he did not see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; to get me,&#8221; said Joan. It
was an entirely unemotional statement of certainty.
</p>
<p>Prosper pressed his lips into a line and narrowed
his eyes upon her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he will?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;ll be takin&#8217; after me. He must &#8216;a&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
ben scairt by somethin&#8217; Pierre said in the town
durin&#8217; their quarrel an&#8217; have come up after him
to look out what Pierre would be doin&#8217; to me....
I wisht he&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; come in time.... What
must he be thinkin&#8217; of me now, to find Pierre
a-lyin&#8217; there dead, an&#8217; me gone! He&#8217;ll be takin&#8217;
after me to bring me home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper would almost have questioned her
then, his sharp face was certainly at that moment
the face of an inquisitor, a set of keen and
delicate instruments ready for probing, but so
weary and childlike did she look, so weary and
childlike was her speech, that he forbore. What
did it matter, after all, what there was in her
past? She had done what she had done, been
what she had been. If the fellow had branded her
for sin, why, she had suffered overmuch. Prosper
admitted, that, unbranded as to skin, he was
scarcely fit to put his dirty civilized soul under
her clean and savage foot. Was the big, rosy
chap her lover? She had spoken of a quarrel between
him and Pierre? But her manner of speaking
of him was scarcely in keeping with the
thought, rather it was the manner of a child-soul
relying on the Shepherd who would be &#8220;takin&#8217;
after&#8221; some small, lost one. Well, he would have
to be a superman to find her here with no trails
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
to follow and no fingers to point. Pierre by now
would have told his story&mdash;and Prosper knew
instinctively that he would tell it straight; whatever
madness the young savage might perpetrate
under the influence of drink and jealousy,
he would hardly, with that harrowed face, be apt
at fabrications&mdash;they would be looking for Joan
to come back, to go to the town, to some neighboring
ranch. They would make a search, but
winter would be against them with its teeth
bared, a blizzard was on its way. By the time
they found her, thought Prosper,&mdash;and he
quoted one of Joan&#8217;s quaint phrases to himself,
smiling with radiance as he did so,&mdash;&#8220;she won&#8217;t
be carin&#8217; to leave me.&#8221; In his gay, little, firelit
room, he sat, stretched out, lank and long, in the
low, deep, red-lacquered chair, dozing through
the long day, sipping strong coffee, smoking,
reading. He was singularly quiet and content.
The devil of disappointment and of thwarted
desire that had wived him in this carefully appointed
hiding-place stood away a little from him
and that wizard imagination of his began to
weave. By dusk, he was writing furiously and
there was a glow of rapture on his face.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE WHOLE DUTY OF WOMAN</h3>
</div>

<p>Joan waited for Holliwell and, waiting, began
inevitably to regain her strength. One
evening as Wen Ho was spreading the table,
Prosper looked up from his writing to see a tall,
gaunt girl clinging to the door-jamb. She was
dressed in the heavy clothes, which hung loose
upon her long bones, her throat was drawn up
to support the sharpened and hollowed face in
which her eyes had grown very large and wistful.
Her hair was braided and wrapped across her
brow, her long, strong hands, smooth and only
faintly brown, were thin, too, and curiously
expressive as they clung to the logs. She was a
moving figure, piteous, lovely, rather like some
graceful mountain beast, its spirit half-broken
by wounds and imprisonment and human tending,
but ready to leap into a savagery of flight or
of attack. They were wild, those great eyes, as
well as wistful. Prosper, looking suddenly up at
them, caught his breath. He put down his book
as quietly as though she had indeed been a wild,
easily startled thing, and, suppressing the impulse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to rise, stayed where he was, leaning a trifle forward,
his hands on the arms of his chair.
</p>
<p>Joan&#8217;s eyes wandered curiously about the brilliant
room and came to him at last. Prosper met
them, relaxed, and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in and dine with me, Joan,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Tell me how you like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt her way weakly to the second large
chair and sat down facing him across the hearth.
The Chinaman&#8217;s shadow, thrown strongly by the
lamp, ran to and fro between and across them.
It was a strange scene truly, and Prosper felt
with exhilaration all its strangeness. This was
no Darby and Joan fireside; a wizard with his
enchanted leopardess, rather. He was half-afraid
of Joan and of himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s right beautiful,&#8221; said Joan, &#8220;an&#8217; right
strange to me. I never seen anything like it before.
That&#8221;&mdash;her eyes followed Wen Ho&#8217;s departure
half-fearfully&mdash;&#8220;that man and all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper laughed delightedly, stretching up his
arms in full enjoyment of her splendid ignorance.
&#8220;The Chinaman? Does he look so strange to
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what he is? I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; She
smiled rather sadly and ashamedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m awful
ignorant, Mr. Gael. I just can read an&#8217; I&#8217;ve only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
read two books.&#8221; She flushed and her pupils
grew large.
</p>
<p>Prosper saw that this matter of reading trod
closely on her pain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a Chinaman from San Francisco.
You know where that is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I&#8217;ve heard talk of it&mdash;out on the
Pacific Coast, a big city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Full of bad yellow men and a few good ones
of whom let&#8217;s hope Wen Ho is one. And full of
bric-à-brac like all these things that surprise you
so. Do you like bright colors, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pondered in the unself-conscious and unhurried
fashion of the West, stroking the yellow,
spotted skin that lay over the black arm of her
chair and letting her eyes flit like butterflies in a
garden on a zigzag journey to one after another
of the flowers of color in the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I c&#8217;d take to &#8217;em better
if they was more one at a time. I mean&#8221;&mdash;she
pushed up the braid a little from wrinkling brows&mdash;&#8220;jest
blue is awful pretty an&#8217; jest green.
They&#8217;re sort of cool, an&#8217; yeller, that&#8217;s sure fine.
You&#8217;d like to take it in your hands. Red is most
too much like feelin&#8217; things. I dunno, it most
hurts an&#8217; yet it warms you up, too. If I hed to
live here&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>Prosper&#8217;s eyebrows lifted a trifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d&mdash;sure clear out the whole of this&#8221;&mdash;and
she swept a ruthless hand.
</p>
<p>Again Prosper made delighted use of that upward
stretching of his arms. He laughed. &#8220;And
you&#8217;d clear me out, too, wouldn&#8217;t you?&mdash;if you
had to live here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Joan. She paused and fastened
her enormous, grave look upon him. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
right soon now to begin to work for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Prosper laughed. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t know the first thing about woman&#8217;s work,
Joan. What could you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan straightened wrathfully. &#8220;I sure do know.
Sure I do. I can cook fine. I can make a room
clean. I can launder&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pooh! The Chinaman does all that as
well&mdash;no, better than you ever could do it.
That&#8217;s not woman&#8217;s work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan saw all the business of femininity swept
off the earth. Profound astonishment, incredulity,
and alarm possessed her mind and so her face.
Truly, thought Prosper, it was like talking to a
grave, trustful, and most impressionable child, the
way she sat there, rather on the edge of her chair,
her hands folded, letting everything he said disturb
and astonish the whole pool of her thought.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Gael, sweepin&#8217;, washin&#8217;, cookin&#8217;,&mdash;ain&#8217;t
all that a woman&#8217;s work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Men can do it so much better,&#8221; said Prosper,
blowing forth a cloud of blue cigarette smoke and
brushing it impatiently aside so that he could
smile at her evident offense and perplexity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they don&#8217;t do it better. They&#8217;re as messy
an&#8217; uncomfortable as they can be when there
ain&#8217;t no woman to look after &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if they get good pay for keeping themselves
and other people tidy. Look at Wen Ho.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Joan, &#8220;that ain&#8217;t properly a man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper laughed out again. It was good to be
able to laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known plenty of real white men who
could cook and wash better than any woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but what is a woman&#8217;s work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper remained thoughtful for a while, his
head thrown back a little, looking at her through
his eyelashes. In this position he was extraordinarily
striking. His thin, sharp face gained by
the slight foreshortening and his brilliant eyes,
keen nose, and high brow did not quite so completely
overbalance the sad and delicate strength
of mouth and chin. In Joan&#8217;s eyes, used to the
obvious, clear beauty of Pierre, Gael was an
ugly fellow, but even she, artistically untrained,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
caught at the moment the picturesqueness and
grace of him, the mysterious lines of texture, of
race; the bold chiselings of thought and experience.
The colors of the room became him, too, for
he was dark, with curious, catlike, greenish eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole duty of woman, Joan,&#8221; he said,
opening these eyes upon her, &#8220;can be expressed
in just one little word&mdash;charm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And again at her look of mystification he
laughed aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s&mdash;there&#8217;s babies,&#8221; suggested Joan
after a pause during which she evidently wrestled
in vain with the true meaning of his speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner is served,&#8221; said Prosper, rising
quickly, and, getting back of her, he pushed her
chair to the table, hiding in this way a silent
paroxysm of mirth.
</p>
<p>At dinner, Prosper, unlike Holliwell, made no
attempt to draw Joan into talk, but sipped his
wine and watched her, enjoying her composed
silence and her slow, graceful movements. Afterwards
he made a couch for her on the floor before
the fire, two skins and a golden cushion, a rug of
dull blue which he threw over her, hiding the
ugly skirt and boots. He took a violin from the
wall and tuned it, Joan watching him with all
her eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like what you&#8217;re playin&#8217; now,&#8221; she
told him, impersonally and gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tuning up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I&#8217;d be gettin&#8217; tired of that if I
was you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost done,&#8221; said Prosper humbly.
</p>
<p>He stood up near her feet at the corner of the
hearth, tucked the instrument under his chin and
played. It was the &#8220;Aubade Provençale,&#8221; and he
played it creditably, with fair skill and with some
of the wizardry that his nervous vitality gave to
everything he did. At the first note Joan started,
her pupils enlarged, she lay still. At the end he
saw that she was quivering and in tears.
</p>
<p>He knelt down beside her, drew the hands
from her face. &#8220;Why, Joan, what&#8217;s the matter?
Don&#8217;t you like music?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan drew a shaken breath. &#8220;It&#8217;s as if it shook
me in here, something trembles in my heart,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I never heerd music before, jest whistlin&#8217;.&#8221;
And again she wept.
</p>
<p>Prosper stayed there on his knee beside her,
his chin in his hand. What an extraordinary being
this was, what a magnificent wilderness. The
thought of exploration, of discovery, of cultivation,
filled him with excitement and delight.
Such opportunities are rarely given to a man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Even that other most beautiful adventure&mdash;yes,
he could think this already!&mdash;might have
been tame beside this one. He looked long at
Joan, long into the fire, and she lay still, with the
brooding beauty of that first-heard melody upon
her face.
</p>
<p>It was the first music she had ever heard, &#8220;except
whistlin&#8217;,&#8221; but there had been a great deal
of &#8220;whistlin&#8217;&#8221; about the cabin up Lone River;
whistling of robins in spring&mdash;nothing sweeter&mdash;the
chordlike whistlings of thrush and vireo
after sunset, that bubbling &#8220;mar-guer-ite&#8221; with
which the blackbirds woo, and the light diminuendo
with which the bluebird caressed the
air after an April flight. Perhaps Joan&#8217;s musical
faculty was less untrained than any other. After
all, that &#8220;Aubade Provençale&#8221; was just the
melodious story of the woods in spring. Every
note linked itself to an emotional, subconscious
memory. It filled Joan&#8217;s heart with the freshness
of childhood and pained her only because it
struck a spear of delight into her pain. She was
eighteen, she had grown like a tree, drinking in
sunshine and storm, but rooted to a solitude
where very little else but sense-experience could
reach her mind. She had seen tragedies of animal
life, lonely death-struggles, horrible flights and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
more horrible captures, she had seen joyous wooings,
love-pinings, partings, and bereavements.
She had seen maternal fickleness and maternal
constancy, maternal savagery; the end of mated
bliss and its&mdash;renewal. She had seen the relentless
catastrophes of storm. There had been starving
winters and renewing springs, sad beautiful
autumns, the riotous waste and wantonness of
summer. These had all been objective experiences,
but Joan&#8217;s untamed and undistracted heart had
taken them in deeply and deeply pondered upon
them. There was no morality in their teachings,
unless it was the morality of complete suspension
of any judgment whatsoever, the marvelous literal,
&#8220;Judge not.&#8221; She knew that the sun shone
on the evil and on the good, but she knew also
that frost fell upon the good as well as upon the
evil nor was the evil to be readily distinguished.
Her father prated of only one offense, her mother&#8217;s
sin. Joan knew that it was a man&#8217;s right to kill
his woman for &#8220;dealin&#8217;s with another man.&#8221; This
law was human; it evidently did not hold good
with animals. There was no bitterness, though
some ferocity, in the traffic of their loves.
</p>
<p>While she pondered through the first sleepless
nights in this strange shelter of hers, and while
the blizzard Prosper had counted on drove bayoneted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
battalions of snow across the plains and
forced them, screaming like madmen, along the
narrow cañon, Joan came slowly and fully to a
realization of the motive of Pierre&#8217;s deed. He had
been jealous. He had thought that she was having
dealings with another man. She grew hot and
shamed. It was her father&#8217;s sin, that branding on
her shoulder, or, perhaps, going back farther, her
mother&#8217;s sin. Carver had warned Pierre&mdash;of the
hot and smothered heart&mdash;to beware of Joan&#8217;s
&#8220;lookin&#8217; an&#8217; lookin&#8217; at another man.&#8221; Now, in
piteous woman fashion, Joan went over and over
her memories of Pierre&#8217;s love, altering them to
fit her terrible experience. It was a different process
from that simple seeing of pictures in the
fire from which she had been startled by Pierre&#8217;s
return. A man&#8217;s mind in her situation would have
been intensely occupied with thoughts of the
new companion, but Joan, thorough as a woman
always is, had not yet caught up. She was still
held by all the strong mesh of her short married
life. She had simply not got as far as Prosper
Gael. She accepted his hospitality vaguely, himself
even more vaguely. When she would be done
with her passionate grief, her laborious going-over
of the past, her active and tormenting anger
with the lover whom Prosper had told her was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
dead, then it would be time to study this other
man. As for her future, she had no plans at all.
Joan&#8217;s life came to her as it comes to a child,
unsullied by curiosity. At this time Prosper was
infinitely the more curious, the more excited of
the two.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A MATTER OF TASTE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What are you writin&#8217; so hard for, Mr. Gael?&#8221;
Joan voiced the question wistfully on the
height of a long breath. She drew it from a silence
which seemed to her to have filled this strange,
gay house for an eternity. For the first time full
awareness of the present cut a rift in the troubled
cloudiness of her introspection. She had been
sitting in her chair, listless and wan, now staring
at the flames, now following Wen Ho&#8217;s activities
with absent eyes. A storm was swirling outside.
Near the window, Prosper, a figure of keen
absorption, bent over his writing-table, his long,
fine hand driving the pencil across sheet after
sheet. He looked like a machine, so regular and
rapid was his work. A sudden sense of isolation
came upon Joan. What part had she in the life
of this companion, this keeper of her own life?
She felt a great need of drawing nearer to him, of
finding the humanity in him. At first she fought
the impulse, reserve, pride, shyness locking her
down, till at last her nerves gave her such torment
that her fingers knitted into each other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and on the outbreathing of a desperate sigh she
spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you writin&#8217; so hard for, Mr. Gael?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once Prosper&#8217;s hand laid down its pencil and
he turned about in his chair and gave her a
gleaming look and smile. Joan was fairly startled.
It was as if she had touched some mysterious
spring and turned on a dazzling, unexpected
light. As a matter of fact, Prosper&#8217;s heart had
leapt at her wistful and beseeching voice.
</p>
<p>He had been biding his time. He had absorbed
himself in writing, content to leave in suspense
the training of his enchanted leopardess. Half-absent
glimpses of her desolate beauty as she
moved about his winter-bound house, contemplation
of her unself-consciousness as she companioned
his meals, the pleasure he felt in her rapt
listening to his music in the still, frost-held evenings
by the fire&mdash;these he had made enough.
They quieted his restlessness, soothed the ache
of his heart, filled him with a warm and patient
desire, different from any feeling he had yet experienced.
He was amused by her lack of interest
in him. He was not accustomed to such through-gazing
from beautiful eyes, such incurious absence
of questioning. She evidently accepted him
as a superior being, a Providence; he was not a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
man at all, not of the same clay as Pierre and
herself. Prosper had waited understandingly
enough for her first move. When the personal
question came, it made a sort of crash in the
expectant silence of his heart.
</p>
<p>Before answering, except by that smile, he lit
himself a cigarette; then, strolling to the fire, he
sat on the rug below her, drawing his knees up
into his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to tell you about my writing, Joan.
After all, it&#8217;s the great interest of my life, and
I&#8217;ve been fairly seething with it; only I didn&#8217;t
want to bother you, worry your poor, distracted
head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought,&#8221; said Joan slowly, &#8220;I never
thought you&#8217;d be carin&#8217; to tell me things. I know
so awful little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your modesty, Joan. It was simply
because you haven&#8217;t given me a thought since I
dragged you in here on my sled. I&#8217;ve been nothing&#8221;&mdash;under
the careless, half-bitter manner,
he was weighing his words and their probable
effect&mdash;&#8220;nothing, for all these weeks, but&mdash;a
provider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A provider?&#8221; Joan groped for the meaning
of the word. It came, and she flushed deeply.
&#8220;You mean I&#8217;ve just taken things, taken your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
kind doin&#8217;s toward me an&#8217; not been givin&#8217; you a
thought.&#8221; Her eyes filled and shone mortification
down upon him so that he put his hand
quickly over hers, tightened together on her
knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor girl! I&#8217;m not reproaching you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Gael, I wanted to work for you.
You wouldn&#8217;t let me.&#8221; She brushed away her
tears. &#8220;What can I do? Where can I go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can stay here and make me happy as
you have been doing ever since you came. I was
very unhappy before. And you can give me just
as much or as little attention as you please. I
don&#8217;t ask you for a bit more. Suppose you stop
grieving, Joan, and try to be just a little happier
yourself. Take an interest in life. Why, you poor,
young, ignorant child, I could open whole worlds
of excitement, pleasure, to you, if you&#8217;d let me.
There&#8217;s more in life than you&#8217;ve dreamed of
experiencing. There&#8217;s music, for one thing, and
there are books and beauty of a thousand kinds,
and big, wonderful thoughts, and there&#8217;s companionship
and talk. What larks we could have,
you and I, if you would care&mdash;I mean, if you
would wake up and let me show you how. You
do want to learn a woman&#8217;s work, don&#8217;t you,
Joan?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>She shook her head slowly, smiling wistfully,
the tears gone from her eyes, which were puzzled,
but diverted from pain. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t savvy what
you meant when you talked about what a
woman&#8217;s work rightly was. An&#8217; I&#8217;m so awful
ignorant, you know so awful much. It scares me,
plumb scares me, to think how much you know,
more than Mr. Holliwell! Such books an&#8217; books
an&#8217; books! An&#8217; writin&#8217; too. You see I&#8217;d be no
help nor company fer you. I&#8217;d like to listen to
you. I&#8217;d listen all day long, but I&#8217;d not be understandin&#8217;.
No more than I understand about that
there woman&#8217;s work idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed at her, keeping reassuring eyes on
hers. &#8220;I can explain anything. I can make you
understand anything. I&#8217;ll grant you, my idea of
a woman&#8217;s work is difficult for you to get hold
of. That&#8217;s a big question, after all, one of the
biggest. But&mdash;just to begin with and we&#8217;ll drop
it later for easier things&mdash;I believe, the world
believes, that a woman ought to be beautiful.
You can understand that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan shook her head. &#8220;It&#8217;s a awful hard sayin&#8217;,
Mr. Gael. It&#8217;s awful hard to say you had ought
to be somethin&#8217; a person can&#8217;t manage for themselves.
I mean&mdash;&#8221; poor Joan, the inarticulate,
floundered, but he left her, rather cruelly, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
flounder out. &#8220;I mean, that&#8217;s an awful hard
sayin&#8217; fer a homely woman, Mr. Gael.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he with a gesture,
&#8220;there is no such thing as a homely woman. A
homely woman simply does not count.&#8221; He got
up, looked for a book, found it, opened it, and
brought it to her. &#8220;Look at that picture, Joan.
What do you think of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was of a woman, a long-drawn, emaciated
creature, extraordinarily artificial in her grace
and in the pose and expression of her ugly,
charming form and features. She had been aided
by hair-dresser and costumer and by her own wit,
aided into something that made of her an arresting
and compelling picture. &#8220;What do you think
of her, Joan?&#8221; smiled Prosper Gael.
</p>
<p>Joan screwed up her eyes distastefully. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
she queer, Mr. Gael? Poor thing, she&#8217;s homely!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He clapped to the book. &#8220;A matter of educated
taste,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know beauty when
you see it. If you walked into a drawing-room
by the side of that marvelous being, do you think
you&#8217;d win a look, my dear girl? Why, your great
brows and your great, wild eyes and your face
and form of an Olympian and your free grace of
a forest beast&mdash;why, they wouldn&#8217;t be noticed.
Because, Joan, that queer, poor thing knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
woman&#8217;s work from A to Z. She&#8217;s beautiful,
Joan, beautiful as God most certainly never
intended her to be. Why, it&#8217;s a triumph&mdash;it&#8217;s
something to blow a trumpet over. It&#8217;s
art!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He returned the volume and came back to
stand by the mantel, half-turned from her, looking
down into the fire. For the moment, he had
created in himself a reaction against his present
extraordinary experiment, his wilderness adventure.
He was keenly conscious of a desire for
civilized woman, for her practiced tongue, her
poise, her matchless companionship....
</p>
<p>Joan spoke, &#8220;You mean I&#8217;m awful homely,
Mr. Gael?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question set him to laughing outrageously.
Joan&#8217;s pride was stung.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no right to laugh at me,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;d not be carin&#8217; what you think.&#8221; And she
left him, moving like an angry stag, head high,
light-stepping.
</p>
<p>He went back to his work, not at all in regret
at her pique and still amused by the utter femininity
of her simple question.
</p>
<p>Before dinner he rapped at her door. &#8220;Joan,
will you do me a favor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A pause, then, in her sweet, vibrant voice, she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
answered, &#8220;I&#8217;d be doin&#8217; anything fer you, Mr.
Gael.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, put on these things for dinner instead
of your own clothes, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She opened the door and he piled into her
arms a mass of shining silk, on top of it a pair of
gorgeous Chinese slippers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it to please me, even if you think it makes
you look queer, will you, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she smiled, looking up from the
gleaming, sliding stuff into his face. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to,
anyway. Dressing-up&mdash;that&#8217;s fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she shut the door.
</p>
<p>She spread the silk out on the bed and found
it a loose robe of dull blue, embroidered in silver
dragons and lined with brilliant rose. There was
a skirt of this same rose-colored stuff. In one
weighted pocket she found a belt of silver coins
and a little vest of creamy lace. There were rose
silk stockings stuffed into the shoes. Joan eagerly
arrayed herself. She had trouble with the vest,
it was so filmy, so vaguely made, it seemed to
her, and to wear it at all she had to divest herself
altogether of the upper part of her coarse underwear.
Then it seemed to her startlingly inadequate
even as an undergarment. However, the
robe did go over it, and she drew that close and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
belted it in. It was provided with long sleeves
and fell to her ankles. She thrilled at the delightful
clinging softness of silk stockings and for the
first time admired her long, round ankles and
shapely feet. The Chinese slippers amused her,
but they too were beautiful, all embroidered with
flowers and dragons.
</p>
<p>She felt she must look very queer, indeed, and
went to the mirror. What she saw there surprised
her because it was so strange, so different. Pierre
had not dealt in compliments. His woman was
his woman and he loved her body. To praise this
body, surrendered in love to him, would have
been impossible to the reverence and reserve of
his passion.
</p>
<p>Now, Joan brushed and coiled her hair, arranging
it instinctively, but perhaps a little in
imitation of that queer picture that had looked
to her so hideous. Then, starting toward the door
at Wen Ho&#8217;s announcement of &#8220;Dinner, lady,&#8221;
she was quite suddenly overwhelmed by shyness.
From head to foot for the first time in all her life
she was acutely conscious of herself.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAINING OF A LEOPARDESS</h3>
</div>

<p>On that evening Prosper began to talk. The
unnatural self-repression he had practiced
gave way before the flood of his sociability. It
was Joan&#8217;s amazing beauty as she stumbled
wretchedly into the circle of his firelight, her
neck drawn up to its full length, her head crowned
high with soft, black masses, her lids dropped
under the weight of shyness, vivid fright in her
distended pupils, scarlet in her cheeks,&mdash;Joan&#8217;s
beauty of long, strong lines draped to advantage
for the first time in soft and clinging fabrics,&mdash;that
touched the spring of Prosper&#8217;s delighted
egotism. There it was again, the ideal audience,
the necessary atmosphere, the beautiful, gracious,
intelligent listener. He forgot her ignorance, her
utter simplicity, the unplumbed emptiness of
her experience, and he spread out his colorful
thoughts before her in colorful words, the mental
plumage of civilized courtship.
</p>
<p>After dinner, now sipping from the small coffee
cup in his hand, now setting it down to move excitedly
about the room, he talked of his life, his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
book, his plans. He told anecdotes, strange adventures;
he drew his own inverted morals; he
sketched his fantastic opinions; he was in truth
fascinating, a speaking face, a lithe, brilliant presence,
a voice of edged persuasion. He turned
witty phrases. Poor Joan! One sentence in ten
she understood and answered with her slow smile
and her quaint, murmured, &#8220;Well!&#8221; His eloquence
did her at least the service of making
her forget herself. She was rather crestfallen because
he had not complimented her; his veiled
look of appreciation, this coming to of his real
self was too subtle a flattery for her perception.
Nevertheless, his talk pleased her. She did not
want to disappoint him, so she drew herself up
straight in the big red-lacquered chair, sipped her
coffee, in dainty imitation of him, gave him the
full, deep tribute of her gaze, asked for no explanations
and let the astounding statements he
made, the amazing pictures he drew, cut their
way indelibly into her most sensitive and preserving
memory.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, at night, for the first time she did
not weep for Pierre, the old lost Pierre who had
so changed into a torturer, but, wakeful, her
brain on fire, she pondered over and over the
things she had just heard, feeling after their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
meaning, laying aside for future enlightenment
what was utterly incomprehensible, arguing with
herself as to the truth of half-comprehended
speeches&mdash;an ignorant child wrestling with a
modern philosophy, tricked out in motley by a
ready wit.
</p>
<p>There were more personal memories that gave
her a flush of pleasure, for after midnight, as she
was leaving him, he came near to her, took her
hand with a grateful &#8220;Joan, you&#8217;ve done so
much for me to-night, you&#8217;ve made me happy,&#8221;
and the request, &#8220;You won&#8217;t put your hair back
to the old way, will you? You will wear pretty
things, if I give them to you, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; in a
beseeching spoiled-boy&#8217;s voice, very amusing and
endearing to her.
</p>
<p>He gave her the &#8220;pretty things,&#8221; whole quantities
of them, fine linen to be made up into underwear,
soft white and colored silks and crêpes,
which Joan, remembering the few lessons in
dressmaking she had had from Maud Upper and
with some advice from Prosper, made up not too
awkwardly, accepting the mystery of them as
one of Prosper&#8217;s magic-makings. And, in the
meantime, her education went on. Prosper read
aloud to her, gave her books to read to herself,
questioned her, tutored her, scolded her so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
fiercely sometimes that Joan would mount scarlet
cheeks and open angry eyes. One day she
fairly flung her book from her and ran out of the
room, stamping her feet and shedding tears. But
back she came presently for more, thirsting for
knowledge, eager to meet her trainer on more
equal grounds, to be able to answer him to some
purpose, to contradict him, to stagger ever so
slightly the self-assurance of his superiority.
</p>
<p>And Prosper enjoyed the training of his captive
leopardess, though he sometimes all but
melted over the pathos of her and had much ado
to keep his hands from her unconscious young
beauty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so changed, Joan,&#8221; he said one day
abruptly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve grown as thin as a reed,
child; I can see every bone, and your eyes&mdash;don&#8217;t
you ever shut them any more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan, prone on the skin before the fire, elbows
on the fur, hands to her temples, face bent over
a book, looked up impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d not be talkin&#8217; now if I was you, Mr. Gael.
You had ought to be writin&#8217; an&#8217; I&#8217;m readin&#8217;.
I can&#8217;t talk an&#8217; read; seems when I do a thing
I just hed to <i>do</i> it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper laughed and returned chidden to his
task, but he couldn&#8217;t help watching her, lying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
there in her blue frock across his floor, like a tall,
thin Magdalene, all her rich hair fallen wildly
about her face. She was such a child, such a
child!

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>JOAN RUNS AWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a January night when Joan, her rough
head almost in the ashes, had read &#8220;Isabella
and the Pot of Basil&#8221; by the light of flames. It
was in March, a gray, still afternoon, when, looking
through Prosper&#8217;s bookcase, she came upon
the tale again.
</p>
<p>Prosper was outdoors cutting a tunnel, freshly
blocked with snow, and Joan, having finished the
&#8220;Life of Cellini,&#8221; a writer she loathed, but whose
gorgeous fabrications her master had forced her
to read, now hurried to the book-shelves in
search of something more to her taste. She had
the gay air of a holiday-seeker, returned &#8220;Cellini&#8221;
with a smart push, and kneeling, ran her
finger along the volumes, pausing on a binding
of bright blue-and-gold. It was the color that had
pleased her and the fat, square shape, also the
look of fair and well-spaced type. She took the
book and squatted on the rug happy as a child
with a new toy of his own choosing.
</p>
<p>And then she opened her volume in its middle
and her eye looked upon familiar lines&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So the two brothers and their murdered man&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Joan&#8217;s heart fell like a leaden weight and the
color dropped from her face. In an instant she
was back in Pierre&#8217;s room and the white night
circled her in great silence and she was going
over the story of her love and Pierre&#8217;s&mdash;their
love, their beautiful, grave, simple love that had
so filled her life. And now where was she? In the
house of the man who had killed her husband!
She had been waiting for Holliwell, but for a long
while now she had forgotten that. Why was she
still here? A strange, guilty terror came with the
question. She looked down at the soft, yellow
crêpe of the dress she had just made and she
looked at her hands lying white and fine and
useless, and she felt for the high comb Prosper
had put into her hair. Then she stared around the
gorgeous little room, snug from the world, so
secret in its winter cañon. She heard Wen Ho&#8217;s incessant
pattering in the kitchen, the crunch and
thud of Prosper&#8217;s shoveling outside. It was suddenly
a horrible nightmare, or less a nightmare
than a dream, pleasant in the dreaming, but
hideous to an awakened mind. She was awake.
Isabella&#8217;s story had thrown her mind, so abruptly
dislocated, back to a time before the change,
back to her old normal condition of a young wife.
That little homestead of Pierre&#8217;s! Such a hunger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
opened in her soul that she bent her head and
moaned. She could think of nothing now but
those two familiar, bare, clean rooms&mdash;Pierre&#8217;s
gun, Pierre&#8217;s rod, her own coat there by the door,
the snowshoes. There was no place in her mind
for the later tragedy. She had gone back of it.
She would rather be alone in her own home,
desolate though it was, than anywhere else in all
the homeless world.
</p>
<p>And what could prevent her from going? She
laughed aloud,&mdash;a short, defiant laugh,&mdash;rippled
to her feet, and, in her room, took off Prosper&#8217;s
&#8220;pretty things&#8221; and got into her own old
clothes; the coarse underwear, the heavy stockings
and boots, the rough skirt, the man&#8217;s shirt.
How loosely they all hung! How thin she was!
Now into her coat, her woolen cap down over her
ears, her gloves&mdash;she was ready, her heart laboring
like an exhausted stag&#8217;s, her knees trembling,
her wrists mysteriously absent. She went into the
hall, found her snowshoes, bent to tie them on,
and, straightening up, met Prosper who had
come in out of the snow.
</p>
<p>He was glowing from exercise, but at sight of
her and her pale excitement, the glow left him
and his face went bleak and grim. He put out
his hand and caught her by the arm and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
backed from him against the wall&mdash;this before
either of them spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He let go of her arm. &#8220;You were going like
this, without a word to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gael,&#8221; she panted, &#8220;I had a feelin&#8217; like
you wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;a&#8217; let me go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned, threw open the door, and stepped
aside. She confronted his white anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gael, I left Pierre dead. I&#8217;ve been a-waitin&#8217;
for Mr. Holliwell to come. I&#8217;m strong
now. I must be a-goin&#8217; home.&#8221; Suddenly, she
blazed out: &#8220;You killed my man. What hev I
to do with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bowed. Her breast labored and all the distress
of her soul, troubled by an instinctive,
inarticulate consciousness of evil, wavered in her
eyes. Her reason already accused her of ingratitude
and treachery, but every fiber of her had
suddenly revolted. She was all for liberty, she
must have it.
</p>
<p>He was wise, made no attempt to hold her, let
her go; but, as she fled under the firs, her webs
sinking deep into the heavy, uncrusted snow, he
stood and watched her keenly. He had not failed
to notice the trembling of her body, the quick
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
lift and fall of her breast, the rapid flushing and
paling of her face. He let her go.
</p>
<p>And Joan ran, drawing recklessly on the depleted
store of what had always been her inexhaustible
strength. The snow was deep and soft,
heavy with moisture, the March air was moist,
too, not keen with frost, and the green firs were
softly dark against an even, stone-colored sky
of cloud. To Joan&#8217;s eyes, so long imprisoned, it
was all astonishingly beautiful, clean and grave,
part of the old life back to which she was running.
Down the cañon trail she floundered, her
short skirt gathering a weight of snow, her webs
lifting a mass of it at every tugging step. Her
speed perforce slackened, but she plodded on,
out of breath and in a sweat. She was surprised
at the weakness; put it down to excitement. &#8220;I
was afeered he&#8217;d make me stay,&#8221; she said, and,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go. I&#8217;ve got to go.&#8221; This went with
her like a beating rhythm. She came to the opening
in the firs, the foot of the steep trail, and out
there stretched the valley, blank snow, blank sky,
here and there a wooded ridge, then a range of
lower hills, blue, snow-mottled; not a roof, not
a thread of smoke, not a sound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awful far away,&#8221; Joan whispered to herself,
and, for the first time in her life, she doubted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
her strength. &#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly know where I am.&#8221;
She looked back. There stood a high, familiar
peak, but so were the outlines of these mountains
jumbled and changed that she could not
tell if Prosper&#8217;s cañon lay north or south of
Pierre&#8217;s homestead. The former was high up on
the foothills, and Pierre&#8217;s was well down, above
the river. From where she stood, there was no
river-bed in sight. She tried to remember the
journey, but nothing came to her except a confused
impression of following, following, following.
Had they gone toward the river first and
then turned north or had they traveled close to
the base of the giant range? The ranger&#8217;s cabin
where they had spent the night, surely that ought
to be visible. If she went farther out, say beyond
the wooded spur which shut the mountain country
from her sight, perhaps she would find it....
She braced her quivering muscles and went on.
The end of the jutting foothills seemed to crawl
forward with her. She plunged into drifts, struggled
up; sometimes the snow-plane seemed to
stand up like a wall in front of her, the far hills
lolling like a dragon along its top. She could not
keep the breath in her lungs. Often she sank
down and rested; when things grew steady she
got up and worked on. Each time she rested, she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
crouched longer; each time made slower progress;
and always the goal she had set herself, the end
of that jutting hill, thrust itself out, nosed forward,
sliding down to the plain. It began to
darken, but Joan thought that her sight was failing.
The enormous efforts she was making took
every atom of her will. At last her muscles refused
obedience, her laboring heart stopped. She
stood a moment, swayed, fell, and this time she
made no effort to rise. She had become a dark
spot on the snow, a lifeless part of the loneliness
and silence.
</p>
<p>Above her, where the sharp peaks touched the
clouds, there came a widening rift showing a
cold, turquoise clarity. The sun was just setting
and, as the cloud-banks lifted, strong shadows,
intensely blue, pointed across the plain of snow.
A small, black, energetic figure came out from
among the firs and ran forward where the longest
shadow pointed. It looked absurdly tiny and
anxious; futile, in its pigmy haste, across the
exquisite stillness. Joan, lying so still, was acquiescent;
this little striving thing rebelled. It
came forward steadily, following Joan&#8217;s uneven
tracks, stamping them down firmly to make a
solid path, and, as the sun dropped, leaving
an immense gleaming depth of sky, he came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
down and bent over the black speck that was
Joan....
</p>
<p>Prosper took her by the shoulder and turned
her over a little in the snow. Joan opened her
eyes and looked at him. It was the dumb look of
a beaten dog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and come home
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She struggled to her feet, he helping her; and
silently, just as a savage woman, no matter what
her pain, will follow her man, so Joan followed
the track he had made by pressing the snow down
triply over her former steps. &#8220;Can you do it?&#8221;
he asked once, and she nodded. She was pale,
her eyes heavy, but she was glad to be found,
glad to be saved. He saw that, and he saw a dawning
confusion in her eyes. At the end he drew her
arm into his, and, when they came into the house,
he knelt and took the snowshoes from her feet,
she drooping against the wall. He put a hand on
each of her shoulders and looked reproach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted to leave me, Joan? You wanted
to leave me, as much as that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shook her head from side to side, then,
drawing away, she stumbled past him into the
room, dropped to the bearskin rug, and held out
her hands to the flames. &#8220;It&#8217;s awful good to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
back,&#8221; she said, and fell to sobbing. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
think you&#8217;d be carin&#8217;&mdash;I was thinkin&#8217; only of
old things. I was homesick&mdash;me that has no
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her shaken voice was so wonderful a music
that he stood listening with sudden tears in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I can&#8217;t ferget Pierre nor the old life,
Mr. Gael, an&#8217; when I think &#8217;t was you that killed
him, why, it breaks my heart. Oh, I know you
hed to do it. I saw. An&#8217; I know I couldn&#8217;t &#8216;a&#8217;
stayed with him no more. What he did, it made
me hate him&mdash;but you can&#8217;t be thinkin&#8217; how
it was with Pierre an&#8217; me before that night. We&mdash;we
was happy. I ust to live with my father,
Mr. Gael, an&#8217; he was an awful man, an&#8217; there
was no lovin&#8217; between us, but when I first seen
Pierre lookin&#8217; up at me, I first knowed what
lovin&#8217; might be like. I just came away with him
because he asked me. He put his hand on my arm
an&#8217; said, &#8216;Will you be comin&#8217; home with me,
Joan Carver?&#8217; That was the way of it. Somethin&#8217;
inside of me said, &#8216;Yes,&#8217; fer all I was too scairt to
do anything but look at him an&#8217; shake my head.
An&#8217; the next mornin&#8217; he was there with his horses.
Oh, Mr. Gael, I can&#8217;t ferget him, even for hatin&#8217;.
That brand on my shoulder, it&#8217;s all healed, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
my heart&#8217;s so hurted, it&#8217;s so hurted. An&#8217; when I
come to thinkin&#8217; of how kind an&#8217; comfortin&#8217; you
are an&#8217; what you&#8217;ve been a-doin&#8217; fer me, why,
then, at the same time, I can&#8217;t help but thinkin&#8217;
that you killed my Pierre. You killed him. Fergive
me, please; I would love you if I could, but
somethin&#8217; makes me shake away from you&mdash;because
Pierre&#8217;s dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she wept, exhausted, broken-hearted
weeping it was. And Prosper&#8217;s face was drawn by
pity of her. That story of her life and love, it was
a sort of saga, something as moving as an old
ballad most beautifully sung. He half-guessed
then that she had genius; at least, he admitted
that it was something more than just her beauty
and her sorrow that so greatly stirred him. To
speak such sentences in such a voice&mdash;that was
a gift. She had no more need of words than had
a symphony. The varied and vibrant cadences
of her voice gave every delicate shading of feeling,
of thought. She was utterly expressive. All
night, after he had seen her eat and sent her to
her bed, the phrases of her music kept repeating
themselves in his ears. &#8220;An&#8217; so I first knowed
what lovin&#8217; might be like&#8221;; and, &#8220;I would love
you, only somethin&#8217; makes me shake away from
you&mdash;because Pierre&#8217;s dead.&#8221; This was a Joan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
he had not yet realized, and he knew that after
all his enchanted leopardess was a woman and
that his wooing of her had hardly yet begun. So
did she baffle him by the utter directness of her
heart. There was so little of a barrier against him
and yet&mdash;there was so much. For the first time,
he doubted his wizardry, and, at that, his desire
for the wild girl&#8217;s love stood up like a giant and
gripped his soul.
</p>
<p>Joan slept deeply without dreams; she had
confessed herself. But Prosper was as restless
and troubled as a youth. She had not made her
escape; she had followed him home with humility,
with confusion in her eyes. She had been
glad to hold out her hands again to the fire on his
hearth. And yet&mdash;he was now her prisoner.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>NERVES AND INTUITION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gael,&#8221; said Joan standing before him
at the breakfast-table, &#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was pale, gaunt, and imperturbable. He
gave her a quick look, one that turned to amusement,
for Joan was really as appealing to his
humor as a child. She had such immense gravity,
such intensity over her one-syllable statements
of fact. She announced this decision and sat
down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s work?&#8221; he asked her, smiling quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; with her own rare smile; &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
rightly fitted for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not in those clothes,&#8221; he murmured
crossly, for she was dressed again in her own
things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to do man&#8217;s work. I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to
shovel snow an&#8217; help fetch wood an&#8217; kerry in
water. You tell your Chinese man, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not going to read or study any
more?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I like that. If you still want to teach
me, Mr. Gael. But I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;m <i>going</i>&mdash;to
get some action. I&#8217;ll just die if I don&#8217;t. Why,
I&#8217;m so poor I can&#8217;t hardly lift a broom. I don&#8217;t
know why I&#8217;m so miserably poor, Mr. Gael.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She twisted her brows anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a nervous breakdown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A <i>what?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nervous breakdown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lit his cigarette and watched her in his
usual lazy, smoke-veiled manner, but she might
have noticed the shaken fabric of his self-assurance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, now,&#8221; said Joan, &#8220;what&#8217;s that the name
for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a book about it over there&mdash;third
volume on the top shelf&mdash;look up your case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With an air of profound alarm, she went over
and took it out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s books about everything, ain&#8217;t there?&mdash;isn&#8217;t
there,&mdash;Mr. Gael? Why, there&#8217;s books
about lovin&#8217; an&#8217; about sickness an&#8217; about cattle
an&#8217; what-not, an&#8217; about women an&#8217; children&mdash;&#8221;
She was shirking the knowledge of her &#8220;case,&#8221;
but at last she pressed her lips together and
opened the book. She fell to reading, growing
anxiety possessed her face, she sat down on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
nearest chair, she turned page after page. Suddenly
she gave him a look of anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t none of this, Mr. Gael,&#8221; she said,
smote the page, rose with dignity, and returned
the book.
</p>
<p>He laughed so long and heartily that she was
at last forced to join him. &#8220;You was&mdash;you were&mdash;jobbin&#8217;
me, wasn&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said, sighing
relief. &#8220;Did you know what that volume said?
It said like this&mdash;I&#8217;ll read you about it&mdash;&#8221; She
took the volume, found the place and read in a
low tone of horror, he helping her with the hard
words: &#8220;&#8216;One of the most frequent forms of phobia,
common in cases of psychic neurasthenia, is
agrophobia in which patients the moment they
come into an open space are oppressed by an
exaggerated feeling of anxiety. They may break
into a profuse perspiration and assert that they
feel as if chained to the ground....&#8217; And here,
listen to this, &#8216;batophobia, the fear that high
things will fall, atrophobia, fear of thunder and
lightning, pantophobia, the fear of every thing
and every one&#8217;.... Well, now, ain&#8217;t that too
awful? An&#8217; you mean folks really get that
way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their talk was for some time of nervous diseases,
Joan&#8217;s horror increasing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said she, &#8220;lead me out an&#8217; shoot
me if I get anyways like that! I believe it&#8217;s
caused by all that queer dressin&#8217; an&#8217; what-not.
I feel like somethin&#8217; <i>real</i> to-day in this shirt an&#8217;
all, an&#8217; when I get through some work I&#8217;ll feel a
whole lot better. Don&#8217;t you say I&#8217;m one of those
nervous breakdowns again, though, will you?&#8221;
she pleaded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t, Joan. But don&#8217;t make one of
me, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By wearing those clothes all day and half the
night. If you expect me to teach you, you&#8217;ll have
to do something for me, to make up for running
away. You might put on pretty things for dinner,
don&#8217;t you think? Your nervous system could
stand that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My nervous system,&#8221; drawled Joan, and
added startlingly, for she did not often swear,
&#8220;God!&#8221; It was an oath of scorn, and again
Prosper laughed.
</p>
<p>But he heard with a sort of terror the sound of
her &#8220;man&#8217;s work&#8221; to which she energetically
applied herself. It meant the return of her
strength, of her independence. It meant the
shortening of her captivity. Before long spring
would rush up the cañon in a wave of melting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
snow, crested with dazzling green, and the valley
would lie open to Joan. She would go unless&mdash;had
he really failed so utterly to touch her heart?
Was she without passion, this woman with the
deep, savage eyes, the lips, so sensuous and pure,
the body so magnificently made for living? She
was not defended by any training, she had no
moral standards, no prejudices, none of the
&#8220;ideals.&#8221; She was completely open to approach,
a savage. If he failed, it was a personal failure.
Perhaps he had been too subtle, too restrained.
She did not yet know, perhaps, what he desired
of her. But he was afraid of rousing her hatred,
which would be fully as simple and as savage as
her love. That evening, after she had dressed to
please him, and sat in her chair, tired, but with
the beautiful, clean look of outdoor weariness on
her face, and tried, battling with drowsiness, to
give her mind to his reading and his talk, he was
overmastered by his longing and came to her and
knelt down, drawing down her hands to him,
pressing his forehead on them.
</p>
<p>For a moment she was stiff and still, then,
&#8220;What is it, Mr. Gael?&#8221; she asked in a frightened
half-voice.
</p>
<p>He felt, through her body, the slight recoil of
spirit, and drew away, and arose to his feet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re angry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I&#8217;m not angry; why should I be?
I&#8217;m a superman. I&#8217;m made&mdash;let&#8217;s say&mdash;of
alabaster. Women with great eyes and wonderful
voices and the beauty of broad-browed
nymphs walking gravely down under forest
arches, such women give me only a great, great
longing to read aloud very slowly and carefully a
&#8216;Child&#8217;s History of the English Race&#8217;!&#8221; He took
the book, tossed it across the room, then stood,
ashamed and defiant, laughing a little, a boy in
disgrace.
</p>
<p>Joan looked at him in profound bewilderment
and dawning distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you <i>are</i> angry with me.
You always are when you talk that queer way.
Won&#8217;t you please explain it to me, Mr. Gael?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said he sharply. &#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221; And he
added after a moment, &#8220;You&#8217;d better go to bed.
You&#8217;re sleepy and as stupid as an owl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And you&#8217;ve destroyed what little superstitious
belief I had left concerning something
they tell little ignorant boys about a woman&#8217;s
intuition. You haven&#8217;t got a bit. You&#8217;re stupid
and I&#8217;m tired of you&mdash;No, Joan, I&#8217;m not.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Don&#8217;t mind me. I&#8217;m only in fun. Please! Damn!
I&#8217;ve hurt your feelings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her lips were quivering, her eyes full. &#8220;I try
so awful hard,&#8221; she said. It was a lovely, broken
trail of music.
</p>
<p>He bent over her and patted her shoulder.
&#8220;Dear child! Joan, I won&#8217;t be so disagreeable
again. Only, don&#8217;t you ever think of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; all the while I&#8217;m thinking of you.
I wisht I could do more for you. Why do I make
you so angry? I know I&#8217;m awful&mdash;awfully stupid
and ignorant. I&mdash;I must drive you most
crazy, but truly&#8221;&mdash;here she turned quickly in
his arm and put her hands about his neck and
laid her cheek against his shoulder&mdash;&#8220;truly,
Mr. Gael, I&#8217;m awful fond of you.&#8221; Then she drew
quickly away, quivered back into the other corner
of her great chair, put her face to her hands.
&#8220;Only&mdash;I can&#8217;t help seein&#8217;&mdash;Pierre.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just her tone showed him that still and ghastly
youth, and again he saw the brown hand that
moved. He had stood between her and that sight.
The man ought to have died. He did not deserve
his life nor this love of hers. Even though he had
failed to kill the man, he would not fail to kill her
love for him, sooner or later, thought Prosper.
If only the hateful spring would give him time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
He must move her from her memory. She had
put her hands about his neck, she had laid her
head against his shoulder, and, if it had been the
action of a child, then she would not have started
from him with that sharp memory of Pierre.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE TALL CHILD</h3>
</div>

<p>There were times, even now, when Prosper
tried to argue himself back into sardonic
self-possession. &#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said his brain, &#8220;you
were beside yourself over a loss and then you
were shut in for months of winter alone with this
mountain girl, so naturally you are off your
balance.&#8221; He would school himself while Joan
shoveled outdoors. He would try to see her with
critical, clear eyes when she strode in. But one
look at her and he was bemused again. For now
she was at a great height of beauty, vivid with
growing strength and purpose, her lips calm and
scarlet, her eyes bright and hopeful. In fact,
Joan had made her plans. She would wait till
spring, partly to get back her full strength, partly
to make further progress in her studies, but
mostly in order not to hurt this hospitable
Prosper Gael. The naïveté of her gratitude, of
her delicate consideration for his feelings, which
continually triumphed over an instinctive fear,
would have filled him with amusement, perhaps
with compunction, had he been capable of understanding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
them. She was truly sorry that she had
hurt him by running away. She told herself she
would not do that again. In the spring she would
make him a speech of thankfulness and of farewell,
and then she would tramp back to Pierre&#8217;s
homestead and win and hold Pierre&#8217;s land. As
yet, you see, Prosper entered very little into her
conscious life. Somewhere, far down in her, there
was a disturbance, a growing doubt, a something
vague and troubling.... Joan had not learnt
to probe her own heart. A sensation was not, or
it was. She was puzzled by the feeling Prosper
was beginning to cause her, a feeling of miserable
complexity; but she was not yet mentally
equipped for the confronting of complexity. It
was necessary for an emotion to rush at Joan
and throw down, as it were, her heart before
she recognized it; even then she might not give
it a name. She would act, however, and with
violence.
</p>
<p>So now she planned and worked and grew
beautiful with work and planning, while Prosper
curbed his passion and worked, too, and his
instruments were delicate and deadly and his
plans made no account of hers. Every word he
read to her, every note he played for her, had its
calculated effect. He worked on her subconsciousness,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
undermining her path, and at nights and in
her sleep she grew aware of him.
</p>
<p>But even now, in his cool and passionate heart
there were moments of reaction, one at last that
came near to wrecking his purpose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your clothes are about done for, Joan,&#8221;
Prosper laughed one morning, watching her belt
in her tattered shirt; &#8220;you&#8217;ll soon look like
Cophetua&#8217;s beggar maid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite barefoot yet.&#8221; She held up a
cracked boot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated an instant, then got
up from his desk, walked to a window, and
looked out at the bright morning. The lake was
ruffled with wind, the firs tossed, there were
patches of brown-needled earth under his window;
his eyes were startled by a strip of green
where tiny yellow flowers trod on the very edge
of the melting drift. The window was open to
soft, tingling air that smelt of snow and of sun,
of pines, of growing grass, of sap, of little leaf-buds.
The birds were in loud chorus. For several
minutes Prosper stared and listened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Gael?&#8221; asked Joan patiently.
</p>
<p>He started. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said without looking at
her again, &#8220;I was going to tell you that there are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
a skirt and a sort of coat in&mdash;in a closet in the
hall. Do you want to use them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went out to look. In five minutes&mdash;he
had gone back to his work at the desk&mdash;he heard
her laugh, and, still laughing, she opened the
door again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Gael, were you really thinking that
I could wear these? Look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned and looked at her. She had crowded
her strong, lithe frame into a brown tweed suit,
a world too narrow for her, and she was laughing
heartily at herself and had come in to show him
the misfit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These things, Mr. Gael,&#8221; she said,&mdash;&#8220;they
must have been made for a tall child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper had too far tempted his pain, and in
her vivid phrase it came to life before him. She
had painted a startling picture and he had seen
that suit, so small and trim, before.
</p>
<p>Joan saw his face grow white, his eyes stared
through her. He drew a quick breath and winced
away from her, hiding his face in his hands. A
moment later he was weeping convulsively, with
violence, his head down between his hands. Joan
started toward him, but he made a wicked and
repellent gesture. She fled into her room and sat,
bewildered, on her bed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>All at once the question came to her: for whom
had the delicate fabrics been bought, for whom
had this suit been made? &#8220;It was his wife and
she is dead,&#8221; thought Joan, and very pitifully
she took off the suit, laid it and the other things
away, and sitting by her window rested her chin
in her hands and stared out through the blue
pines. Tears ran down her face because she was
so sorry for Prosper&#8217;s pain. And again, thought
Joan, she had caused it, she who owed him everything.
Yes, she was deeply sorry for Prosper,
deeply; her whole heart was stirred. For the first
time she had a longing to comfort him with her
hands.
</p>
<p>For all that day Prosper fled the house and
went across the country, now fording a flood of
melted snow, now floundering through a drift,
now walking on springy sod, unaware of the soft
spring, conscious only of a sort of fire in his
breast. He suffered and he resented his suffering,
and he would have killed his heart if, by so doing,
he could have given it peace. And all day he did
not once think of Joan, but only of the &#8220;tall
child&#8221; for whom the gay cañon refuge had been
built, but who had never set her slim foot upon
its threshold. Sunset found him miles away in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
the foothills of a low, many-folded range across
the plain. He was dog tired, so that for very exhaustion
his brain had stopped its tormenting
work. He lit a fire and sat by it, huddled in his
coat, smoking, dozing, not able really to sleep
for cold and hunger. The bright stars, flung all
about the sky, mildly regarded hum. Coyotes
mourned their loneliness and hunger near and
far, and once, in the broken woods above him, a
mountain lion gave its blood-curdling scream.
Prosper hated the night and its beautiful desolation,
he hated the God that had made this land.
He cursed the dawn when it came delicately,
spreading a green arc of radiance across the east.
And then, as he arose stiffly, stamped out his
fire, and started slowly on his way back, he was
conscious of a passionate homesickness, not for
the old life he had lost, but for his cabin, his
bright hearth, his shut-in solitude, his Joan.
Very dear and real and human she was, and her
laughter had been sweet. He had shocked it to
silence, he had repulsed her comforting hands.
She had been so innocent of any desire to hurt
him. He could not imagine her ever hurting any
one, this broad-browed Joan. She was so kind.
And now she must be anxious about him. She
would have sat up by the fire all night.... His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
eagerness for her slighted comfort gave his lagging
steps a certain vigor, the long walk back
seemed very long, indeed. Noon was hot, but he
found water and by sundown he came to the
cañon trail. He wanted Joan as badly now as a
hurt child wants its mother. He came, haggard
and breathless, to the door, called &#8220;Joan,&#8221; came
into the warm little room and found it empty.
Wen Ho, to be sure, pattered to meet him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Gael been gone a long time, velly
long, all night. Wen Ho, he fix bed, fix breakfast&mdash;oh,
the lady? She gone out yestiddy, not come
back. She leave a letter for him, there on the
table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper took it, waved Wen Ho out, and,
dropping into the big chair, opened the paper.
There was Joan&#8217;s big handwriting, that he himself
had taught her. Before she could only sign
her name.
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>Mister Gael, dere frend,</i>&mdash;

<p>There were blistered spots above that pathetic,
mistaken signature. The poor girl had meant to
sign herself &#8220;Respectfully,&#8221; and somehow that
half-broke his heart.
</p>
<p>He drank the strong coffee Wen Ho brought
for him, two great cups of it, and he ate a piece
of broiled elk meat. Then he went out again and
walked rapidly down the trail. It was not yet
dark; the world was in a soft glow of rose and
violet, opalescent lights. The birds were singing
in a hundred chantries. And there, through the
firs, a sight to stop his heart, Joan came walking
toward him, graceful, free, a swinging figure,
bareheaded, her rags girded beautifully about
her. And up and up to him she came soundlessly
over the pine needles and through the wet snow-patches,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
looking at him steadfastly and tenderly,
without a smile. She came and stood before him,
still without dropping her sad, grave look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gael,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I hev come back. I got
out yonder an&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;her breast heaved and a sort
of terror came into her eyes&mdash;&#8220;an&#8217; the world
was awful lonely. There ain&#8217;t a creature out
yonder to care fer me, fer me to care fer. It seemed
like as if it was all dead. I couldn&#8217;t abear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put out her hand wistfully asking for pity,
but he fell upon his knees and wrapped his hungry
arms about her. &#8220;Joan,&#8221; he sobbed, &#8220;Joan!
Don&#8217;t leave me. Don&#8217;t&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t bear it!&#8221;
He looked up at her, his worn face wet with tears.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me, Joan! I want you. Don&#8217;t you
understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her deep gray eyes filled slowly with light, she
put a hand on either side of his face and bent her
lips to his. &#8220;I never thought you&#8217;d be wantin&#8217;
<i>me</i>,&#8221; she said.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING MARRIAGE</h3>
</div>

<p>And it was spring-time; these prisoners of
frost were beautifully sensitive. They, too,
with the lake and the aspens and the earth, the
seeds and the beasts, had suffered the season of
interment. In such fashion Nature makes possible
the fresh undertakings of last summer&#8217;s reckless
prodigals; she drives them into her mock
tomb and freezes their hearts&mdash;it is a little rest
of death&mdash;so that they wake like turbulent
bacchantes drunk with sleep and with forgetfulness.
Love, spring says, is an eternal fact, welcome
its new manifestations. Remating bluebirds
built their nests near Joan&#8217;s window; they were
not troubled by sad recollections of last year&#8217;s
nests nor the young birds that flew away. It was
another life, a resurrection. If they remembered
at all, they remembered only the impulses of
pleasure; they had somewhere before learned how
to love, how to build; the past summers had given
practice to their singing little throats and to their
rapid wings. No ghosts forbade happiness and no
God&mdash;man-voiced&mdash;saying, because he knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the ugly human aftermaths, hard sayings of &#8220;Be
ye perfect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>What counsel was theirs for Joan and what
had her human mentor taught her? He had
taught her in one form or another the beauty of
passion and its eternal sinlessness, for that was
his sincere belief. By music he had taught her,
by musical speech, by the preaching of heathen
sage and the wit of modern arguers. He had
given her all the moral schooling she had ever
had and its golden rule was, &#8220;Be ye beautiful
and generous.&#8221; Joan was both beautiful and
made for giving, &#8220;free-hearted&#8221; as she might
herself have said, Friday&#8217;s child as the old rhyme
has it,&mdash;and to cry out to her with love, saying,
&#8220;I want you, Joan,&#8221; was just, sooner or later, to
see her turn and bend her head and hold out her
arms. Prosper had the reward of patience; his
wild leopardess was tamed to his hand and her
sweetness made him tender and very merciful.
</p>
<p>Their gay, little house stood open all day while
they explored the mountains and plunged into
the lake, choosing the hot hour of noon. Joan
made herself mistress of the house and did her
woman&#8217;s work at last of tidying and beautifying
and decking corners with gorgeous branches of
blossoms while Prosper worked at his desk. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
was happy; the reality of Joan&#8217;s presence had
laid his ghost just as the reality of his had laid
hers. His work went on magically and added the
glow of successful creation to the glow of satisfied
desire. And his sin of deceit troubled him very
little, for he had worked out that problem and
had decided that Pierre, dead or alive, was unworthy
of this mate.
</p>
<p>But sometimes in her sleep Joan would start
and moan feeling the touch of the white-hot iron
on her shoulder. Her hatred of Pierre&#8217;s cruelty,
her resolution to be done with him forever, must
have vividly renewed itself in those dreams, for
she would cling to Prosper like a frightened child,
and wake, trembling, happy to find herself safe
in his arms.
</p>
<p>So they lived their spring. Wen Ho, the silent
and inscrutable, went out of the valley for provisions,
and during his absence Joan queened it
in the kitchen. She was learning to laugh, to see
the absurd, delightful twists of daily living, to
mock Prosper&#8217;s oddities as he mocked hers. She
was learning to be a comrade and she was learning
better speech and more exquisite ways. It
was inevitable that she should learn. Prosper, in
these days, spent his whole soul upon her, fed
her with music and delight, and he trained her to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
sing her sagas so that every day her voice gained
in power and flexible sweetness. She would sing,
since he told her to, her voice beating its wings
against the walls of the house or ringing down the
cañon in untrammeled flight. Prosper was lost
in wonder of her, in a passionate admiration for
his own handiwork. He was making, here in this
God-forsaken solitude, a thing of marvel; what
he was making surely justified the means. Joan&#8217;s
laughable simplicity and directness were the
same; they were part of her essence; no civilizing
could confuse or disturb them; but she changed,
her brain grew, it absorbed material, it attempted
adventures. Nowadays Joan sometimes argued,
and this filled Prosper with delight, so quaint
and logical she was and so skillful.
</p>
<p>They were reading out under the firs by the
green lip of the lake, when Wen Ho led his pack-horse
up the trail. He had been gone a month,
for Prosper had sent him out of the valley to a
distant town for his supplies. He didn&#8217;t want
the little frontier place to prick up its ears. Wen
Ho had ridden by a secret trail back over the
range; he had not passed even the ranger station
on his way. He called out, and, in the
midst of a sentence Joan was reading, Prosper
started up.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>Joan looked at him smiling. &#8220;You&#8217;re as easily
turned away from learning as a boy,&#8221; she began,
and faltered when she saw his face. It was turned
eagerly toward the climbing horses, toward the
pack, and it was sharp and keen with detached
interest, an excitement that had nothing, nothing
in the world to do with her.
</p>
<p>It was the great bundle of Prosper&#8217;s mail that
first brought home to Joan the awareness of an
outside world. She knew that Prosper was a
traveled and widely experienced man, but she
had not fancied him held to this world by human
attachments. Concerning the &#8220;tall child&#8221; she
had not put a question and she still believed her
to have been Prosper&#8217;s wife. But when, leaving
her place under the tree, she came into the house
and found Prosper feverishly slitting open envelope
after envelope, with a pile of papers and magazines,
ankle-high, beside him on the floor, she
stood aghast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lot of people must have been writing
to you, Prosper!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not hear her. He was greedy of eye and
fingertips, searching written sheet after sheet.
He was flushed along the cheek-bones and a little
pale about the lips. Joan stood there, her hands
hanging, her head bent, staring up and out at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
him from under her brows. She looked, in this
attitude, rather dangerous.
</p>
<p>Prosper sped through his mail, made an odd
gesture of desperation, sat still a moment staring,
his brilliant, green-gray eyes gone dull and
blank, then he gave himself a shuddery shake,
pulled a small parcel from under the papers, and
held it out to Joan. He smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something for you, leopardess,&#8221; he said&mdash;he
had told her his first impression of her.
</p>
<p>She took the box haughtily and walked with
it over to her chair. But he came and kissed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous of my mail? You foolish child. What
a girl-thing you are! It doesn&#8217;t matter, does it,
how we train you or leave you untrained, you&#8217;re
all alike, you women, under your skins. Open
your box and thank me prettily, and leave matters
you don&#8217;t understand alone. That&#8217;s the way
to talk, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flushed and smiled rather doubtfully, but,
at sight of his gift, she forgot everything else for
a moment. It was a collar of topaz and emerald
set in heavy silver. She was awe-struck by its
beauty, and went, after he had fastened it for
her, to stand a long while before the glass looking
at it. She wore her yellow dress cut into a V at
the neck and the jewels rested beautifully at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
base of her long, round throat, faintly brown like
her face up to the brow. The yellow and the green
brought out all the value of her grave, scarlet
lips, the soft, even tints of her skin, the dark
lights and shadows of her hair and eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful. I
love it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All the time very grave and still, she took it
off, put it on its box, and laid it on the mantel.
Then she went out of doors.
</p>
<p>Prosper hurried to the window and saw her
walk out to the garden they had made and begin
her work. He was puzzled by her manner, but
presently shrugged the problem of her mood
away and went back to his mail. That night he
finished his novel and got it ready for the publisher.
</p>
<p>Again Wen Ho, calm and uncomplaining, was
sent out over the hill, and again the idyll was renewed,
and Joan wore the collar and was almost
as happy as before. Only one night she startled
Prosper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked Pierre,&#8221; she said slowly, after a
silence, in her low-pitched voice, &#8220;when he was
taking me away home, I asked, &#8216;Where are you
going?&#8217; and he said to me, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you savvy the
answer to that question, Joan?&#8217; And, Prosper, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
didn&#8217;t savvy, so he told me and he looked at me
sort of hard and stern, &#8216;We&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to be
married, Joan.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper and Joan were sitting before the fire,
Joan on the bearskin at his feet, he lounging
back, long-legged, smoke-veiled, in one of the
lacquered chairs. She had been fingering her
collar and she kept on fingering it as she spoke
and staring straight into the flames, but, at the
last, quoting Pierre&#8217;s words and tone, her voice
and face quivered and she looked at him with
eyes of mysterious pain, in them a sort of uncomprehended
anguish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why was that, Prosper?&#8221; she asked; &#8220;I
mean, why did he say it that way? And what&mdash;what
does it stand for, marrying or not&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper jerked a little in his chair, then said
he blasphemously, &#8220;Marriage is the sin against
the Holy Ghost. Don&#8217;t be the conventional
woman, Joan. Isn&#8217;t this beautiful, this life of
ours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; But her eyes of uncomprehended pain
were still upon him. So he put his hand over
them and drew her head against his knee. &#8220;Yes,
but that other life was&mdash;was&mdash;before Pierre
changed, it was beautiful&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Love is always beautiful. Not even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
marriage can always spoil it, though it very often
does. Well, Joan,&#8221; he went on flippantly, though
the tickle of her lashes against his palm somehow
disturbed his flippancy, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go into the subject
with you one of these days, when the weather
isn&#8217;t so beautiful. It&#8217;s really a matter of law,
property rights, and so forth; a practice variously
conducted in various lands; it&#8217;s man&#8217;s most
studied insult to woman; it&#8217;s recommended as
the lesser of two evils by a man who despised
woman as only an Oriental can despise her, Saint
Paul by name; it&#8217;s a thing civilized women cry
for till they get it and then quite bitterly learn
to understand; it&#8217;s a horrible invention which
needn&#8217;t touch your beautiful clean soul, dear.
Come out and look at the moon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; They stood side by side at the door.
&#8220;Some silly bird thinks that is the dawn. Look
at me, Joan!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She lifted obedient eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There! That&#8217;s better. Don&#8217;t get that other
look. I can&#8217;t bear it. I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment later they went out into the sweet,
silver silence down to the silver lake.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Four months later the name of Prosper Gael
began to be on every one&#8217;s lips, and before every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
one&#8217;s eyes; the world, his world, began to clamor
for him. Even Wen Ho grumbled at this going
out on tremendous journeys after the mail for
which Prosper grew more and more greedy and
impatient. His novel, &#8220;The Cañon,&#8221; had been
accepted, was enormously advertised, had made
an extraordinary success. All this he explained
to Joan, who tried to rejoice because she saw
that it was exquisite delight to Prosper. He was
by way of thinking now that his exile, his Wyoming
adventure, was to thank for his success,
but when a woman, even such a woman as Joan,
begins to feel that she has been a useful emotional
experience, there begins pain. For Joan pain
began and daily it increased. It was suffering for
her to watch Prosper reading his letters, forwarded
to him from the Western town where his
friends and his secretary believed him to be recovering
from some nervous illness; to watch
him smoking and thinking of himself, his fame,
his talents, his future; to watch him scribbling
notes, planning another work, to hear his excited
talk, now so impersonal, so unrelated to her;
to see how his eagerness over her education
slackened, faltered, died; to notice that he no
longer watched the changeful humors of her
beauty nor cared if she wore bronze or blue or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
yellow; and worst of all, to find him staring at
her sometimes with a worried, impatient look
which scuttled out of sight like some ugly, many-legged
creature when it met her own eyes&mdash;painful,
of course, yet such an old story. Joan,
who had never heard of such experience, did not
foresee the inevitable end, and, in so much, she
was spared. The extra pain of forfeiting her dignity
and self-respect did not touch her, for she
made none of those most pitiful, unavailing
efforts to hold him, to cling; did not even pretend
indifference. She only drew gradually into herself,
shrinking from her pain and from him as the
cause of it; she only lost her glow of love-happiness,
her face seemed dwindled, seemed to contract,
and that secret look of a wild animal returned
to her gray eyes. She quietly gave up the
old regulations of their life; she did not remind
him of the study-hours, the music-hours, the
hours of wild outdoor play. She read under the
firs, alone; she studied faithfully, alone; she
climbed and swam, alone&mdash;or with his absent-minded,
fitful company; she worked in her garden,
alone. At night, when he was asleep, she lay
with her hand pressed against her heart, staring
at the darkness, listening to the night, waiting.
Curiously enough, his inevitable returns of passion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
and interest, the always decreasing flood-mark,
each time a line lower, did not deceive her,
did not distract her. She never expressed her
trouble, even to herself. She did not give it any
words. She took her pain without wincing, without
complaint, and when he seemed to need her
in any little way, in any big way, she gave because
she could not help it, because she had
promised him largesse, because it was her nature
to give. Besides, although she was instinctively
waiting, she did not foresee the end.
</p>
<p>It was in late October when, somewhere in the
pile of Prosper&#8217;s mail, there lay a small gray
envelope. Joan drew his attention to it, calling
it a &#8220;queer little letter,&#8221; and he took it up slowly
as though his deft and nervous fingers had gone
numb. Before he opened it he looked at Joan and,
in one sense, it was the last time he ever did look
at her; for at that moment his stark spirit looked
straight into hers, acknowledged its guilt, and
bade her a mute and remorseful farewell.
</p>
<p>He read and Joan watched. His face grew pale
and bright as though some electric current had
been turned into his veins; his eyes, looking up
from the writing, but not returning to her, had
the look given by some drug which is meant to
stupefy, but which taken in an overdose intoxicates.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
He turned and made for the door, holding
the little gray folded paper in his hand. On the
threshold he half-faced her without lifting his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had extraordinary news, Joan. I shall
have to go off alone and think things out. I don&#8217;t
know when I shall get back.&#8221; He went out and
shut the door gently.
</p>
<p>Joan stood listening. She heard him go along
the passage and through the second door. She
heard his feet on the mountain trail. Afterwards
she went out and stood between the two sentinel
firs that had marked the entrance to that snow-tunnel
long since disappeared. Now it was a late
October day, bright as a bared sword. The flowers
of the Indian paint-brush burned like red candle
flames everywhere under the firs, the fire-weed
blazed, the aspen leaves were laid like little
golden tiles against the metallic blue of the sky.
The high peak pointed up dizzily and down,
down dizzily into the clear emptiness of the lake.
This great peak stood there in the glittering stillness
of the day. A grouse boomed, but Joan was
not startled by the sudden rush of its wings. She
felt the sharp weight of that silent mountain in
her heart; she might have been buried under it.
So she felt it all day while she worked, a desperate,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
bright day,&mdash;hideous in her memory,&mdash;and
at night she lay waiting. After hours longer
than any other hours, the door of her bedroom
opened and an oblong of moonlight, as white as
paper, fell across the matted floor. Prosper
stepped in noiselessly and walked over to her bed.
He stood a moment and she heard him swallow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awake, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her eyes were staring up at him, but she lay
still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Joan.&#8221; He spoke in short sentences,
waiting between each for some comment of hers
which did not come. &#8220;I shall have to go away
to-morrow. I shall have to go away for some time.
I don&#8217;t want you to be unhappy. I want you to
stay here for a while if you will, for as long as
you want to stay. I am leaving you plenty of
money. I will write and explain it all very clearly
to you. I know that you will understand. Listen.&#8221;
Here he knelt and took her hands, which he found
lying cold and stiff under the cover, pressed
against her heart. &#8220;I have made you happy here
in this little house, haven&#8217;t I, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She would not answer even this except by the
merest flicker of her eyelids.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have trusted me; now, trust me a little
longer. My life is very complicated. This beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
year with you, the year you have given to me,
is just a temporary respite from&mdash;from all sorts
of things. I&#8217;ve taught you a great deal, Joan.
I&#8217;ve healed the wound that brute made on your
shoulder and in your heart. I&#8217;ve taught you to
be beautiful. I&#8217;ve filled your mind with beauty.
You are a wonderful woman. You&#8217;ll live to be
grateful to me. Some day you&#8217;ll tell me so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her quiet, curved lips moved. &#8220;Are you tellin&#8217;
me good-bye, Prosper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was impossible to lie to her. He bent his
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Joan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell it quick and go out and leave me
here to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was impossible to touch her. She might have
been wrapped in white fire. He found that though
she had not stirred a finger, his hand had shrunk
away from hers. He got to his feet, all the cleverness
which all day long he had been weaving like
a silk net to catch, to bewilder, to draw away her
brain from the anguish of full comprehension,
was shriveled. He stood and stared helplessly at
her, dumb as a youth. And, obedient, he went
out and shut the door, taking the white patch of
moonlight with him.
</p>
<p>So Joan, having waited, behind an obstinately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
locked door, for his departure, came out at noon
and found herself in the small, gay house alone.
</p>
<p>She sat in one of the lacquered chairs and saw
after a long while that the Chinaman was looking
at her.
</p>
<p>Wen Ho, it seemed, had been given instructions.
He was to stay and take care of the house
and the lady for as long as she wanted it, or him.
Afterwards he was to lock up the house and go.
He handed her a large and bulky envelope which
Joan took and let lie in her lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go to-morrow, Wen Ho,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You no wait for Mr. Gael come back? He
say he come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m not going to wait. I guess&#8221;&mdash;here
Joan twisted her mouth into a smile&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
not one of the waiting kind. I&#8217;m a-going back
to my own ranch now. It won&#8217;t seem so awful
lonesome, perhaps, as I was thinking last spring
that it would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She touched the envelope without looking at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this money, Wen Ho?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tink so, lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She held it, unopened, out to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give it to you, then. I have no need of
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood up.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am going out now to climb up this mountain
back of the house so&#8217;s I can see just where
I am. I&#8217;ll come down to-night for dinner and to-morrow
after breakfast I&#8217;ll be going away. You
understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady, you mean give me all this money?&#8221;
babbled the Chinaman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joan gravely; &#8220;I have no need of
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went past him with her swinging step.
</p>
<p>She was coming down the mountain-side that
evening, very tired, but with the curious, peaceful
stillness of heart that comes with an entire
acceptance of fate, when she heard the sound of
horses&#8217; hoofs in the hollow of the cañon. Her
heart began to beat to suffocation. She ran to
where, standing near a big fir tree, she could look
straight down on the trail leading up to Prosper&#8217;s
cabin. Presently the horsemen came in sight&mdash;the
one that rode first was tall and broad and
fair, she could see under his hat-brim his straight
nose and firmly modeled chin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sin-buster!&#8221; said Joan; then, looking at
the other, who rode behind him, she caught at
the tree with crooked hands and began to sink
slowly to her knees. He was tall and slight, he
rode with inimitable grace. As she stared, he took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
off his sombrero, rested his hand on the saddle-horn,
and looked haggardly, eagerly, up the trail
toward the house. His face was whiter, thinner,
worn by protracted mental pain, but it was the
beautiful, living face of Pierre.
</p>
<p>Joan shrank back into the shadows of the
pines, crouched for a few minutes like a mortally
wounded beast, then ran up the mountain-side
as though the fire that had once touched her
shoulder had eaten its way at last into her heart.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A WILD CAT</h3>
</div>

<p>The Lazy-Y ranch-house, a one-storied
building of logs, was built about three sides
of a paved court. In the middle of this court
stood a well with a high rustic top, and about
this well on a certain brilliant July night, a tall
man was strolling with his hands behind his back.
It was a night of full moon, sailing high, which
poured whiteness into the court, making its cobbles
embedded in the earth look like milky bubbles
and drawing clear-cut shadows of the well-top
and the gables and chimneys of the house.
The man slowly circled the court beginning close
to the walls and narrowing till he made a loop
about the well, and then, reversing, worked in
widening orbits as far as the walls again. His
wife, looking out at him through one of the windows,
thought that, in the moonlight, followed
by his own squat, active shadow, he looked like
a huge spider weaving a web. This effect was
heightened by the fact that he never looked up.
He was deep in some plan to which it was impossible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
for her not to believe that the curious pattern
of his walk bore some relation.
</p>
<p>From the northern wing of the ranch-house,
strongly lighted, came a tumult of sound; music,
thumping feet, a man&#8217;s voice chanting couplets:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Oh, you walk right through and you turn around</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>and swing the girl that finds you,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And you come right back by the same old track</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>and turn the girl behind you.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Some one was directing a quadrille in native
fashion. There was much laughter, confusion,
and applause. None of this noise disturbed the
man. He did not look at the lighted windows.
He might really have been a gigantic insect
entirely unrelated to the human creatures so
noisily near at hand.
</p>
<p>A man came round the corner of the house,
crossed the square, and, lurching a little, made
for the door of the lighted wing. Shortly after
his entrance the sound of music and dancing
abruptly stopped. This stillness gave the spider
pause, but he was about to renew his weaving,
when, in the silence, a woman spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Mabel, don&#8217;t you go home,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>She had not spoken loudly, but her voice beat
against the walls of the court as though it could
have filled the whole moonlight night with dangerous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
beauty. The listener outside lifted his
head with a low, startled exclamation. Suddenly
the world was alive with adventure and
alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind your own business, you wild cat,&#8221; answered
a man&#8217;s raucous voice. &#8220;She&#8217;s my wife,
which is somethin&#8217; that your sort knows nothin&#8217;
about. Come on, you Mabel. You think that
outlaw can keep me from takin&#8217; home my wife,
you&#8217;re betting wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Another silence; then the voice again, a little
louder, as though the speaker had stepped out
into the center of the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mabel is not a-goin&#8217; home with you,&#8221; it said;
and the listener outside threw back his head with
the gesture of a man sensitive to music who listens
to some ecstatic melody. &#8220;She happens to
be stoppin&#8217; here with us to-night. You say that
she&#8217;s your wife, but that don&#8217;t mean that she
belongs to you, body and soul, Bill Greer&mdash;not
to you, who don&#8217;t possess your own body, or soul.
Why, you can&#8217;t keep your feet steady, you can&#8217;t
pull your hand away from mine. You can&#8217;t hold
your tipsy eyes on mine. Do you call that ownin&#8217;
your own body? And as fer your soul, it&#8217;s a hell
of rage and dirty feelin&#8217;s that I&#8217;d hate to burn
my eyes by lookin&#8217; closely at.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>A deep, short, alarming chorus of laughter
interrupted the speech. The speaker evidently
had her audience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you don&#8217;t own anything to-night,&#8221; went
on the extraordinary, deliberate voice; &#8220;surely
you don&#8217;t own Mabel. You can&#8217;t get a claim on
her, not thataway. She&#8217;s her own. She belongs
to her own self. When you&#8217;re fit to take her, why,
then come and tell us about it, and if we judge
you&#8217;re a-tellin&#8217; us the truth, mebbe we&#8217;ll let her
go. Till then&mdash;&#8221; a pause which was filled with
a rapid shuffling of feet. The door flew open and
in its lighted oblong the observer saw a huddled
figure behind which rose a woman&#8217;s black and
shapely head. &#8220;Till then,&#8221; repeated the deep-toned,
ringing voice, &#8220;<i>get out</i>!&#8221; And the huddled
man came on a staggering run which ended in a
backward fall on the cobbles of the court.
</p>
<p>The man who watched trod lightly past him
and came to the open door. Inside, firelight beat
on the golden log walls and salmon-colored timber
ceiling; a lamp hanging from a beam threw
down a strong, conflicting arc of white light.
A dozen brown-faced, booted young men stood
about, three musicians were ready to take up
their interrupted music, the little fat man who
had called out the figures of the quadrille, stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
on a barrel, his arms folded across his paunch.
A fair-haired girl, her face marred by recent tears,
drooped near him. Two of the young men were
murmuring reassurances to her; others surrounded
a stout, red-faced girl who was laughing
and talking loudly. The Jew&#8217;s eyes wandered till
they came to the fireplace. There another woman
leaned against the wall.
</p>
<p>The music struck up, the dancing began again,
the two other girls, quickly provided with partners,
began to waltz, the superfluous men stood
up together and went at it with gravity and
grace. No one asked this woman, who stood at
ease, watching the dancers, her hands resting on
her hips, her head tilted back against the logs.
As he looked at her, the intruder had a queer
little thrill of fright. He remembered something
he had once seen&mdash;a tame panther which was
to be used in some moving-picture play. Its confident
owner had led it in on a chain and held it
negligently in a corner of the room, waiting for
his cue. The panther had stood there drowsily,
its eyes shifting a little, then, watching people,
its inky head had begun to move from side to
side. He remembered the way the loose chain
jerked. The animal&#8217;s eyes half-closed, it lowered
its head, its upper lip began to draw away from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
its teeth. All at once it had dropped on its belly.
Some one cried out, &#8220;Hold your beast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This young woman by the fireplace had just
that panther-air of perilous quietness. She was
very haggard, very thin; she wore her massive,
black hair drawn away hideously from brow and
temple, and out of this lean, unshaded face a
pair of deep eyes looked drowsily, dangerously.
Her mouth was straightened into an expression
of proud bitterness, her round chin thrust forward;
there was a deep, scowling line that rose
from the bridge of her straight, short nose almost
to the roots of her hair. It cut across a splendidly
modeled brow. She was very graceful, if such a
bundle of bones might be said to have any grace.
Her pose was arresting. There was a tragic force
and attraction about her.
</p>
<p>The man by the door appraised her carefully
between his narrowed lids. He kept in mind the
remembered melody of her voice, and, after a few
moments, he strolled across the floor and came
up to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you dance?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>He had a very charming and subtle smile, a
very charming and sympathetic look. The woman
was startled, color rose into her face. She stared
at him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not dancing, Mr. Morena,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my name,&#8221; smiled Morena; &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t know yours. I&#8217;ve been on Mr. Yarnall&#8217;s
ranch for a month. Why haven&#8217;t I seen you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fer not lookin&#8217;, I suppose.&#8221; She had given
him that one startled glance, and now she had
turned her eyes back to the dancers and wore
a grim, contemptuous air. Her speeches, though
they were cut into short, crisp words, were full
of music of a sharp, metallic quality different
from the tone of her other speech, but quite as
beautifully expressive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I smoke?&#8221; asked Morena. He was still
smiling his charming smile and watching her out
of the corners of his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hinderin&#8217; you any,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>Morena smiled deeper. He took some time
making and lighting his cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t smoke, yourself?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor dance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor behave prettily to polite young men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the woman looked at him. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t
so awful young, are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed aloud.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I amuse you, don&#8217;t I? Well, I&#8217;m not always
so all-fired funny,&#8221; drawled the creature, lowering
her head a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve heard that you&#8217;re not. You rather
run things here, I gather; got the boys &#8216;plumb-scared&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Yarnall tell you that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve just in the last few minutes remembered
who you are. You&#8217;re Jane. You cook for
the &#8216;outfit,&#8217; and Yarnall was telling us the other
night how he sent one of the boys out for a cook,
the last one, a man, having been beaten up, and
how the boy had brought you back behind him
on his saddle. He said you&#8217;d kept order for him
ever since, were better than a foreman. Who was
the man you threw out to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; drawled Jane, &#8220;he was just a feller
who asked too many questions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Morena&#8217;s smile deepened into his cheeks.
He gave way, in the Jewish fashion so deceptively
suggestive of meekness and timidity, when it is,
at its worst, merely pliable insolence, at its best,
pliable determination. &#8220;You must pardon me,
Miss Jane,&#8221; he said in his murmuring, cultivated
voice. &#8220;You see I&#8217;ve had a great misfortune.
I&#8217;ve never been in your West. I&#8217;ve lived in New
York where good manners haven&#8217;t time or space
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
to flourish. I hadn&#8217;t the least intention of being
impertinent. Do you want me to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved as if to leave her, and she did not
lift a finger to detain him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not carin&#8217;. Do as you please,&#8221; she said
with entire indifference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Morena, looking back at her, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t stay where people are &#8216;not carin&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave him an extraordinarily intelligent
look. &#8220;I should say that&#8217;s the only place you&#8217;d
be wantin&#8217; to stay in at all&mdash;where you&#8217;re not
exactly urged to come,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Morena flushed and his lids flickered. He was
for an instant absurdly inclined to anger and
made two or three steps away. But he came
back.
</p>
<p>He bowed and spoke as he would have spoken
to a great lady, suavely, deferentially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night. I wish I could think that you
have enjoyed our talk as greatly as I have, Miss
Jane. I should very much like to be allowed to
repeat it. May I be stupidly personal and tell
you that you are very beautiful?&#8221; He bowed,
gave her an upward look and went out, finding
his way cleverly among the dancers.
</p>
<p>Outside, in the moonlit court, he stood, threw
back his head and laughed, not loudly but consumedly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
He was remembering her white face of
mute astonishment. She looked almost as if his
compliment had given her sharp pain.
</p>
<p>Morena went laughing to his room in the
opposite wing. He wanted to describe the interview
to his wife.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MORENA&#8217;S WIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>Betty Morena was sitting in a rustic
chair before an open fire, smoking a cigarette.
She was a short woman, so slenderly, even
narrowly built, as to appear overgrown, and she
was a mature woman so immaturely shaped and
featured as to appear hardly more than a child.
Her curly, russet hair was parted at the side, her
wide, long-lashed eyes were set far apart, her
nose was really a finely modeled snub,&mdash;more, a
boy&#8217;s nose even to a light sprinkling of freckles,&mdash;and
her mouth was provokingly the soft, red
mouth of a sorrowful child. She lounged far down
in her chair, her slight legs, clad in riding-breeches
of perfect cut, stretched out straight, her limber
arms along the arms of the chair, her chin sunk
on her flat chest, and her big, clear eyes staring
into the fire. It was an odd figure of a wife for
Jasper Morena, a Jew of thirty-eight, producer
and manager of plays.
</p>
<p>When Betty Kane had run away with him,
there had been lamentation and rage in the houses
of Kane and of Morena. To the pride of an old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Hebrew family, the marriage even of this wandering
son with a Gentile was fully as degrading
as to the pride of the old Tory family was the
marriage with a Jew. Her perverse Gaelic blood
on fire with the insults heaped upon her lover,
Betty, seventeen years old, romantic, clever,
would have walked over flint to give her hand to
him. That was ten years ago. Now, when Jasper
came into her room, she drew her quick brows
together, puffed at her cigarette, and blinked as
though she was looking at something distasteful
and at the same time rather alarming.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they stopped dancing, Jasper?&#8221; she
asked in a voice that was at once brusque and
soft.
</p>
<p>Jasper rubbed his hands delightedly. He was
still merry, and came to stand near the fire,
looking down at her with eyes entirely kind
and admiring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever noticed Jane, who cooks for
the outfit, Betty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s horrible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s extraordinary, and I mean to get hold
of her for Luck&#8217;s play. Did you read it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The play is absolutely dependent on the
leading part and I have found it simply impossible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
to fill. Now, here&#8217;s a woman of extraordinary
grace and beauty&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty lifted skeptical eyebrows, twisted her
limber mouth, but forbore to contradict.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And with a magical voice&mdash;a woman who
not only looks the part, but is it. You remember
Luck&#8217;s heroine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty flicked off the ash of her cigarette and
looked away. &#8220;A savage, isn&#8217;t she? The man has
her tamed, takes her back to London, and there
gives her cause for jealousy and she springs on
him&mdash;yes, I remember. This woman, Jane, is absolutely
without education and hasn&#8217;t a notion
of acting, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper rubbed his hands with increased delight.
&#8220;Not a notion and she murders the King&#8217;s English.
But she is Luck&#8217;s savage and&mdash;in spite of
your eyebrows, Betty&mdash;she is beautiful. I can
school her. It will take money, no end of patience,
but I can do it. It&#8217;s one of the things I
can do. But, of course, there&#8217;s the initial difficulty
of persuading her to try it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That oughtn&#8217;t to be any difficulty at all. Of
course she&#8217;ll jump at the chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure. She was ready to throw me
out of the kitchen to-night. She is really a virago.
Do you know what one of the men said about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
her?&#8221; Jasper laughed and imitated the gentle
Western drawl. &#8220;Jane&#8217;s plumb movin&#8217; to me.
She&#8217;s about halfway between &#8216;You go to hell&#8217;
and &#8216;You take me in your arms to rest.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty smiled. Her smile was vastly more mature
than her appearance. It was clever and cynical
and cold. The Oriental, looking down at her,
lost his merriment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel better, dear?&#8221; he asked timidly.
&#8220;Do you think you will be able to go back next
week?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood up as he came nearer and walked
over to the little table that played the part of
dressing-table under a wavy mirror. &#8220;Oh, yes.
I am quite well. I don&#8217;t think the doctors have
much sense. I&#8217;m sure I hadn&#8217;t anything like a
nervous breakdown. I was just tired out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper drew back the hand whose touch she
had eluded, and nervously, his long supple fingers
a little unsteady, lighted a cigarette. At that
moment he did not look like a spider, but like a
lover who has been hurt. Betty could see in the
mirror a distorted image of his dejected gracefulness,
but, entirely unmoved, she put up her
thin, brown hands and began to take the pins
out of her hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your Jane experiment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
me know how you get on with it and whether I
can help. I shall have to turn in now. I&#8217;m dead
beat. Yarnall took me halfway up the mountain
and back. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper looked at her, then pressed his lips into
a straight line and went to the door which led
from her bedroom to his. He said &#8220;Good-night&#8221;
in a low tone, glanced at her over his shoulder,
and went out.
</p>
<p>Betty waited an instant, then slowly unlaced
her heavy, knee-high boots, took them off, and
began to walk to and fro on stocking feet, hands
clasped behind her back. With her curly hair all
about her face and shoulders, she looked like a
wild, extravagantly naughty school-girl, a girl in a
wicked temper, a rebel against authority. In fact,
she was rejoicing that this horrible enforced visit
to the West was all but over. One week more!
She was almost at an end of her endurance. How
she hated the beautiful white night outside, those
mountain peaks, the sound of that rapid river,
the stillness of sagebrush, the voice of the big
pines! And she hated the log room, its simplicity
now all littered with incongruous luxuries; ivory
toilet articles on the board table; lacy, beribboned
underwear thrown over the rustic chair;
silver-framed photographs; an exquisite, gold-mounted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
crystal vase full of wild flowers on the
pine shelf; satin bedroom slippers on the clay
hearth; a gorgeous, fur-trimmed dressing-gown
over the foot of her narrow, iron cot; all the
ridiculous necessities that Betty&#8217;s maid had put
into her trunk. Yes, Betty hated it all because
it was what she had always thirsted for. What a
malevolent trick of fate that Jasper should have
brought her to Wyoming, that the doctor had
insisted upon at least a month of just this life.
&#8220;Take her West,&#8221; he had said, and Betty, lying
limp and white in her bed, her small head sunk
into the pillow, had jerked from head to foot.
&#8220;Take her West. I know a ranch in Wyoming&mdash;Yarnall&#8217;s.
She&#8217;ll get outdoor exercise, tonic air,
sound sleep, release from all these pestiferous
details, like a cloud of flies, that sting women&#8217;s
nerves to death. Don&#8217;t pay any attention to
whether she likes it or not. Let her behave like a
naughty child, let her kick and scream and cry.
Pick her up, Morena, and carry her off. Do you
hear? Don&#8217;t let her make you change your plans.&#8221;
The doctor had seen his patient&#8217;s convulsive jerk.
&#8220;Pack her up. Make your reservations and go
straight to &#8216;Buck&#8217; Yarnall&#8217;s ranch, Lazy-Y,&mdash;that&#8217;s
his brand, I believe,&mdash;Middle Fork,
Wyoming. I&#8217;ll send him a wire. He knows me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
She needs all outdoors to run about in. She needs
joggin&#8217; around all day through the sagebrush on
a cow-pony in that sun; she needs the smell of a
camp-fire&mdash;Gad! wish I could get back to it
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty, having heard this out, began to laugh.
She laughed till they gave her something to keep
her quiet. But, except for that laughter, she had
made no protest whatever; she did not &#8220;kick and
scream and cry.&#8221; In fact, though she looked like
a child, she was not at all inclined to such exhibitions.
This doctor had not seen her through her
recent ordeal. Two years before her breakdown,
Jasper had been terribly hurt in an automobile
accident, and Betty had come to him at the hospital,
had waited, as white as a snow-image, for
the result of the examination. They had told her
emphatically that there was no hope. Jasper
Morena could not live for more than a few days.
She must not allow herself to hope. He might or
might not regain consciousness. If he did, it
would be for a few minutes before the end. Betty
had listened with her white, rigid, child face,
had thanked them, had gone home. There in her
exquisite, little sitting room above Central Park,
she had sat at her desk and written a few lines on
square, gray note paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Jasper is dying,&#8221; she had written. &#8220;By the
time you get this, he will be dead. If you can forgive
me for having failed in courage last year,
come back. What I have been to you before I
will be again, only, this time we can love openly.
Come back.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>Then she had dropped her head on the desk
and cried. Afterwards she had addressed her letter
to a certain Prosper Gael. The letter went to
Wyoming. When it reached its destination, it
was taken over a mountain-range by a patient
Chinaman.
</p>
<p>Three days later Jasper regained consciousness
and began slowly to return to health. He had the
tenacious vitality of his race, and, in his own
spirit, an iron will to live. He kept Betty beside
his bed for hours, and held her cold hand in his
long, sensitive one, and he stared at her under
his lashes till she thought she must go mad. But
she did not. She nursed him through an interminable
convalescence. She received Prosper,
very early in this convalescence, by her husband&#8217;s
bed, and Jasper had murmured gratitude
for the emotion that threatened to overwhelm
his friend. It was not till some time&mdash;an extraordinarily
long time&mdash;after Morena&#8217;s complete
recovery that she had snapped like a broken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
icicle. And then, forsooth, they had sent her to
Wyoming to get back her health!
</p>
<p>Having paced away some of her restlessness,
Betty stopped by the cabin window and pushed
aside one of the short, calico curtains. She looked
out on the court. A tall woman had just pulled up
a bucket of water from the well and had emptied
it into a pitcher. She finished, let the bucket drop
with a whirr and a clash, and raised her head.
For a second she and Jasper Morena&#8217;s wife looked
at each other. Betty nodded, smiled, and drew
the curtain close.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>JANE</h3>
</div>

<p>After that night, there began a sort of persecution,
skillfully conducted by Jasper and
Betty, against the ferocity of Jane. It was a persecution
impossible to imagine in any other setting,
even the social simplicity of Lazy-Y found
itself a trifle amused. For Jasper, the stately
Jewish figure, would carry pails of water for
Jane from the well to the kitchen, would help
her in the vegetable garden, and to straighten
out her recalcitrant stove-pipe; Betty would put
on an apron a mile too large, to wash dishes and
shell peas. She would sit on the kitchen table
swinging her long, childlike legs and chatter amiably.
Jasper talked, too, to the virago, talked
delightfully, about horses and dogs,&mdash;he had a
charming gift of humorous observation,&mdash;talked
about hunting and big-game shooting, about
trapping, about travel, and, at last, about plays.
Undoubtedly Jane listened. Sometimes she
laughed. Once in a while she ejaculated, musically,
&#8220;Well!&#8221; Occasionally she swore.
</p>
<p>One afternoon he met her riding home from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
an errand to a neighboring ranch, and, turning
his horse, rode with her. In worn corduroy skirt,
flannel shirt, and gray sombrero, she looked like
a handsome, haggard boy, and, that afternoon,
there was a certain unusual wistfulness in her
eyes, and her mouth had relaxed a little from its
bitterness. Perhaps it was the beauty of a clear,
keen summer day; without doubt, also, she was
touched by the courteous pleasure of his greeting
and by his giving up his ride in order to accompany
her. She even unbent from her silence and,
for the first time, really talked to him. And she
spoke, too, in a new manner, using her beautiful
voice with beautiful carefulness. It was like a
master-musician who, after a long illness, takes
up his beloved instrument and tentatively tests
his shaken powers. Jasper had much ado to keep
his surprise to himself, for the rough ranch girl
could speak pure enough English if she would.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and your wife are leaving soon?&#8221; she
asked him, and, when he nodded, she gave a sigh.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be missing you,&#8221; she said, throwing away
her <i>brusquerie</i> like a rag with which she was done.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been company for me. You&#8217;ve made
use of lots of patience and courage, but I have
really liked it. I&#8217;ve not got the ways of being
sociable and I don&#8217;t know that I want ever to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
get them. I am not seeking for friends. There
isn&#8217;t another person on the ranch that would
dare talk to me as you and Mrs. Morena have
talked. They don&#8217;t know anything about me
here and I don&#8217;t mean that they should know.&#8221;
She paused, then gave way to an impulse of confidence.
&#8220;One of the boys asked me to marry
him. He came and shouted it through the window
and I caught him with a pan of water.&#8221; She
sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know rightly if he meant it for
a joke or not, but the laugh wasn&#8217;t on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper controlled his laughter, then saw the dry
humor of her eyes and lips and let out his mirth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sir,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;you&#8217;d be surprised
at the foolishness of men. Sometimes it seems
that, just for pure contrariness, they want to
marry her that least wants them about. The day
I came tramping into this valley, I stopped for
food at the ranch of an old bachelor down yonder
at the ford. And he invited me to be his wife
while I was drinking a glass of water from his
well. He told me how much money he had and
said he&#8217;d start my stove for me winter mornings.
There&#8217;s a good husband! And he was sure kind
to me even when I told him &#8216;no.&#8217; &#8217;T was that
same evening that the boy from Lazy-Y rode in
and claimed me for a cook. Mr. Yarnall is a trusting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
man. He took me and didn&#8217;t ask any questions.
I told him I was &#8216;Jane&#8217; and that I wasn&#8217;t
planning to let him know more. He hasn&#8217;t asked
me another question since. He&#8217;s a gentleman, I
figure it, and he&#8217;s kind of quiet himself about
what he was before he came to this country.
He&#8217;s a man of fifty and he has lots back of
him only he&#8217;s taken a fresh start.&#8221; She sighed,
&#8220;Folks like you and Betty seem awfully open-hearted.
It&#8217;s living in cities, I suppose, where
every one knows every one else so well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This astonishing picture of the candid simplicity
of New York&#8217;s social life absorbed Jasper&#8217;s
attention for some time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to live in a city, Jane?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed her short, boyish &#8220;Hoo!&#8221; &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t what I would like, Mr. Morena,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d like to see the world. I would like to
be that fellow who was condemned to wander all
over the earth and never to die. He was a Jew,
too, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper flushed. People were not in the habit of
making direct reference to his nationality, and,
being an Israelite who had early cut himself off
with dislike from his own people and cultivated
the society of Gentiles, &#8220;a man without a country,&#8221;
he was acutely sensitive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Wandering Jew? Yes. Where did you
ever hear of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I read his story,&#8221; she answered absently; &#8220;an
awful long one, but interesting, about lots of
people, by Eugène Sue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper&#8217;s lips fell apart and he stared. She had
spoken unwittingly and he could see that she
was not thinking of him, that she was far away,
staring beyond her horse&#8217;s head into the broad,
sunset-brightened west.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you schooled?&#8221; he asked her.
</p>
<p>He had brought her back and her face stiffened.
She gave him a startled, almost angry look, dug
her heels into her horse and broke into a gallop;
nor could he win from her another word.
</p>
<p>A few days before he left, he took Yarnall into
his confidence. At first the rancher would do
nothing but laugh. &#8220;Jane on the boards! That&#8217;s
a notion!&#8221; followed by explosion after explosion
of mirth. The Jew waited, patient, pliant, smiling,
and then enumerated his reasons. He talked
to Yarnall for an hour, at the end of which time,
Yarnall, his eyes still twinkling, sent for Jane.
</p>
<p>The two men sat in a log-walled room, known
as the office. Yarnall&#8217;s big desk crowded a stove.
There was no other furniture except shelves and
a box seat beneath a window. Jasper sat on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
end of the desk, swinging his slim, well-booted
leg; Yarnall, stocky, gray, shabby, weather-beaten,
leaned back in his wicker chair. The door
which Jasper faced was directly behind Yarnall.
When Jane opened it, he turned.
</p>
<p>The girl looked grim and a little pale. She was
evidently frightened. This summons from Yarnall
suggested dismissal or reproof. She came
around to face him and stood there, looking fierce
and graceful, her head lowered, staring gloomily
at him from under her brows. To Jasper she gave
not so much as a glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jane, I fancy I shall have to let you
go,&#8221; said Yarnall. He was not above tormenting
the wild-cat. Female ferocity always excites the
teasing boy in a man. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting too ambitious
for us. You see, once these rich New Yorkers
take you up, you&#8217;re no more use to a plain ranchman
like me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you drivin&#8217; at?&#8221; asked Jane.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let me explain it to her, Yarnall!&#8221; Jasper
snapped his elastic fingers, color had risen to his
face, and he looked annoyed. &#8220;Miss Jane, won&#8217;t
you sit down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jane turned her deep, indignant eyes upon him.
&#8220;Are you and your wife the rich New Yorkers he
says are takin&#8217; me up?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. He&#8217;s joking. This is a serious business.
It&#8217;s of vital importance to me and it ought to be
of vital importance to you. Please do sit down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jane took a long step back and sat down on
the settle under the long, horizontal window. She
folded her hands on her knee and looked up at
Morena. She had transferred her attention completely
to him. Yarnall watched them. He was
an Englishman of much experience and this
picture of the skillful, cultivated, handsome
Jew angling deftly for the gaunt, young savage
diverted him hugely. He screwed up his eyes
to get a picture of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a producer and manager of plays,&#8221; said
Jasper, &#8220;which means that I take a play written
by a more gifted man and arrange it for the stage.
Have you ever seen a play?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have some idea what they are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I have read them. Shakespeare wrote
quite a lot of that kind of talking pieces, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper was less surprised than Yarnall. &#8220;At
present I have a play on my hands which is a
very brilliant and promising piece of work, but
which I have been unable to produce for lack of
a heroine. There isn&#8217;t an actress on my list that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
can take the part and do it justice. Now, Miss
Jane, I believe that with some training you could
take it to perfection. My wife and I would like
to take you to New York, paying all your expenses,
of course, and put you into training at
once. It would take a year&#8217;s hard work to get
you fitted for the part. Then next fall we could
bring out the play and I think I can promise you
success and fame and wealth in no small measure.
I don&#8217;t know you very well; I don&#8217;t know
whether or not you are ambitious; but I do know
that every woman must love beauty and ease
and knowledge and experience. For what else,&#8221;
he smiled, &#8220;did Eve eat the apple? All these you
can have if you will let us take you East. Of
course, if I find you cannot take this part, I will
hold myself accountable for you. I will not let
you be a loser in any way by the experiment.
With your beauty&#8221;&mdash;Yarnall fell back in his
chair and gaped from the excited speaker to the
silent listener&mdash;&#8220;and your extraordinary voice,
and your magnetism, you must be especially
fitted for a career of some kind. I promise to find
you your career.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Every drop of blood had fallen from Jane&#8217;s
face and the rough hands on her knee were locked
together.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What part,&#8221; she asked in a quick, low voice,
&#8220;is this that you think I could learn to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper changed his position. He came nearer
and spoke more rapidly. &#8220;It is the story of a girl,
a savage girl, whom a man takes up and trains.
He trains her as a professional might train a
lioness. It is a passion with him to break spirits
and shape them to his will. He trains her with
coaxing and lashing&mdash;not actual lashing, though
I believe in one place he does come near to beating
her&mdash;and he gets her broken so that she
lies at his feet and eats out of his hand. All this,
you understand, while he&#8217;s an exile from his own
world. Then, in the second act,&mdash;that is the
second part of the play,&mdash;he takes his tamed
lioness back to civilization. They go to London
and there the woman does his training infinite
credit. She is extraordinarily beautiful; she is
civilized, successful, courted. Her eccentricities
only add to her charm. So it goes on very prettily
for a while. Then he makes a mistake. He blunders
very badly. He gives his lioness cause for
jealousy and&mdash;to come to the point&mdash;she flies
at his throat. You see, he hadn&#8217;t really tamed
her. She was under the skin, a lioness, a beast,
at heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper had been absorbed in the plot and had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
not noticed Jane, but Yarnall for several minutes
had been leaning forward, his hands tightened
on the arms of his chair. The instant Jasper
stopped he held up his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quiet, Jane,&#8221; he said softly as a man might
speak to a plunging horse. &#8220;Steady!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jane got to her feet. She was very white. She
put up her hand and pressed the back of it against
her forehead and from under this hand she
looked at the two men with eyes of such astonished
pain and beauty as they could never forget.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said presently; &#8220;that&#8217;s something
I <i>could</i> do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once Jasper hastened to retrieve his error.
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry. I&#8217;ve been horribly clumsy.
Do forgive me. Do let me explain. I didn&#8217;t mean
that you were a wild&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let the hand fall and held it up to stop his
speech. &#8220;I&#8217;m not taking offense, Mr. Morena,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You say you arrange plays and that
you have been seeking for some one to play that
girl, that lioness-girl who wasn&#8217;t rightly tamed,
though the man had done his worst to break
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper nodded with a puzzled, anxious air.
For all his skill and subtlety, he could not interpret
her tone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you think I&#8217;m beautiful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, I know you are,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You try to disguise it. And I know that in
many other ways you disguise yourself. I think
you make a great mistake. Your work is hard
and rough&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m not complaining of my work,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s rough and so am I. Oh, yes, I&#8217;m
real, true rough. I was born to roughness and
raised to it. I&#8217;m not anything I don&#8217;t seem, Mr.
Morena. I&#8217;ve had rough travel all my days, only&mdash;only&mdash;&#8221;
She sat down again, twisting her
hands painfully in her apron and bending her
face down from the sight of the two men. The
line of her long, bent neck was a beautiful thing
to see. She spoke low and rapidly, holding down
her emotion, though she could not control all
the exquisite modulations of her voice. &#8220;There&#8217;s
only one part of my travel that I want to forget
and that&#8217;s the one smooth bit. And it&#8217;s hateful
to me and you&#8217;ve been reminding me of it. I must
tell you now that I&#8217;d rather be burnt by a white-hot
iron&#8221;&mdash;here she gave him a wide and horrified
look like a child who speaks of some dreadful
remembered punishment&mdash;&#8220;than do that
thing you&#8217;ve asked of me. I hate everything
you&#8217;ve been telling me about. I don&#8217;t want to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
beautiful. I don&#8217;t want any one to be telling me
such things. I don&#8217;t want to be any different
from what I am now. This is my real self. It is.
I hate beauty. I hate it. I&#8217;m not good enough to
love it. Beauty and learning and&mdash;and music&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her head had been bending lower and lower,
her voice rocking under its weight of restrained
anguish. On the word &#8220;music&#8221; she dropped her
head to her knees and was silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk no more,&#8221; she said, after a moment,
and she stood up and ran out of the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be d&mdash;&mdash;d!&#8221; swore Yarnall.
</p>
<p>But Jasper stood, his face pale, smiting one
hand into the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that I, at least, deserve to be,&#8221; he said.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>FLIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a girl named Joan who followed
Pierre Landis because he laid his hand upon
her wrist, and there was another Joan who fled
up the mountain-side at sight of him, as though
the fire that had once touched her shoulder had
burnt its way into her heart. Then there was a
third Joan, a Joan astray. It was this Joan that
had come to Lazy-Y Ranch and had cooked for
and bullied &#8220;the outfit&#8221;&mdash;a Joan of set face
and bitter tongue, whose two years&#8217; lonely battle
with life had twisted her youth out of its first
comely straightness. In Joan&#8217;s brief code of
moral law there was one sin&mdash;the dealings of a
married woman with another man. When Pierre&#8217;s
living and seeking face looked up toward her
where she stood on the mountain-side above
Prosper&#8217;s cabin, she felt for the first time that
she had sinned, and so, for the first time, she
was a sinner, and the inevitable agony of soul
began.
</p>
<p>She fled and hid till dark, then prowled about
till she knew that Wen Ho was alone in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
house. She came like a spirit from hell and questioned
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did the men ask? What did you tell
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men had asked for a lady. He had told
them, as Prosper had once instructed him, that
no lady was living there, that the man had just
gone. They had been satisfied and had left. But
Joan was still in terror. Pierre must never find
her now. She had accepted the lie of a stranger,
had left her husband for dead, had made no effort
to ascertain the truth, and had &#8220;dealings with
another man.&#8221; Joan sat in judgment and condemned
herself to loneliness. She turned herself
out from all her old life as though she had been
Cain, and, following Wen Ho&#8217;s trail over the
mountains, had gone into strange lands to work
for her bread. She called herself &#8220;Jane&#8221; and her
ferocity was the armor for her beauty. Always
she worked in fear of Pierre&#8217;s arrival, and, as
soon as she had saved money enough for further
traveling, she moved on. She worked by preference
on lonely ranches as cook or harvester, and
it was after two years of such life that she had
drifted into Yarnall&#8217;s kitchen. She was then
greatly changed, as a woman who works to the
full stretch of her strength, who suffers privation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and hardship, who gives no thought to her own
youth and beauty, and who, moreover, suffers
under a scourge of self-scorn and fear, is bound
to change. Of all the people that had seen her
after months of such living, Jasper Morena was
the only one to find her beautiful. But with his
sensitive observation he had seen through the
shell to the sweetness underneath; for surely
Joan was sweet, a Friday&#8217;s child. It was good
that Jasper had torn the skin from her wound,
good that he had broken up the hardness of her
heart. She left him and Yarnall that afternoon
and went away to her cabin in the trees and lay
face down on the bare boards of the floor and
was young again. Waves of longing for love and
beauty and adventure flooded her. For a while
she had been very beautiful and had been very
passionately loved; for a while she had been surrounded
by beauty and taught its meanings. She
had fled from it all. She hated it, yes, but she
longed for it with every fiber of her being. The
last two years were scalded away. She was Joan,
who had loved Pierre; Joan, whom Prosper Gael
had loved.
</p>
<p>Toward morning, dawn feeling with white
fingers through the pine boughs into her uncurtained
window, Joan stopped her weeping and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
stood up. She was very tired and felt as though
all the hardness and strength had been beaten
from her heart. She opened her door and looked
at pale stars and a still, slowly brightening world.
In a hollow below the pines a stream ran and
poured its hoarse, hurrying voice into the silence.
Joan bent under the branches, undressed and
bathed. The icy water shocked life back into her
spirit. She began to tingle and to glow. In spite
of herself she felt happier. She had been stony
for so long, neither sorrowful nor glad; now,
after the night of sharp pain, she was aware of
the gladness of morning. She came up from her
plunge, glowing and beautiful, with loose, wet
hair.
</p>
<p>In the corral the men were watering their
teams; above them on the edge of a mesa, against
the rosy sky, the other ponies, out all night on
the range, were trooping, driven by a cowboy
who darted here and there on his nimble pony,
giving shrill cries. In the clear air every syllable
was sharp to the ear, every tint and line sharp to
the eye. It was beautiful, very beautiful, and it
was near and dear to her, native to her&mdash;this
loveliness of quick action, of inarticulate calling
to dumb beasts, of work, of simple, often repeated
beginnings. She was glad that she was working
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
with her hands. She twisted up her hair and went
over to the ranch-house where she began soberly
and thankfully to light her kitchen fire.
</p>
<p>It was after breakfast, two or three mornings
later, when a stranger on a chestnut pony rode
into Yarnall&#8217;s ranch, tied his pony to a tree, and,
striding across the cobbled square, came to
knock at the office door. At the moment, Yarnall,
on the other side of the house, was saying farewell
to his guests, and helping the men pile the
baggage into the two-seated wagon, so this other
visitor, getting no answer to his knock, turned
and looked about the court. He did not, it was
evident, mind waiting. It was to be surmised
from the look of him that he was used to it; patient
and not to be discouraged by delay. He was
a very brown young man of quite astounding
beauty and his face had been schooled to keenness
and restraint. He was well-dressed, very
clean, an outdoor man, a rider, but a man who
had, in some sense, arrived. He had the inimitable
stamp of achievement. He had been hard
driven&mdash;the look of that, too, was there; he
had been driven to more than ordinary effort.
One of the men, seeing him, walked over and
spoke respectfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to see Mr. Yarnall?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; The man&#8217;s eyes were searching the
ranch-house wistfully again. &#8220;I would like to see
him if I can. I have some questions to ask him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s round the house, gettin&#8217; rid of a bunch
of dudes. Some job. Both hands tied up. Will
you go round or wait?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger dropped to his heels, squatted,
and rolled a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;You can let him
know when the dudes make their get-away.
He&#8217;ll get round to me. My name? It won&#8217;t mean
anything to him&mdash;Pierre Landis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not go round the house, and Yarnall,
being very busy and perturbed for some time
after the departure of his guests, did not get
round to him till nearly noon. By that time he
was sitting on the step, his back against the wall,
still smoking and still wistfully observant of his
surroundings.
</p>
<p>He stood up when Yarnall came.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said the latter; &#8220;that fool boy didn&#8217;t
tell me you were here till ten minutes ago. Come
in. You&#8217;ll stop for dinner&mdash;if we get any to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Pierre.
</p>
<p>He came in and talked and stayed for dinner.
Yarnall was used to the Western fashion of doing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
business. He knew that it would be a long time
before the young man would come to his point.
But the Englishman was in no hurry, for he liked
his visitor and found his talk diverting enough.
Landis had been in Alaska&mdash;a lumber camp.
He had risen to be foreman and now he was off
for a vacation, but had to go back soon. He had
been everywhere. It seemed to Yarnall that the
stranger had visited every ranch in the Rocky
Mountain belt.
</p>
<p>After dinner, strolling beside his host toward
his horse, Pierre spoke, and before Yarnall had
heard a word he knew that the long delay had
been caused by suppressed emotion. Pierre,
when he did ask his question, was white to the lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a lot of your time,&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;I came to ask you about someone. I heard that
you had a woman on your ranch, a woman who
came in and didn&#8217;t give you any history. I want
to see her if I may.&#8221; He was actually fighting an
unevenness of breath, and Yarnall, unemotional
as he was, was gripped with sympathetic suspense.
&#8220;I want,&#8221; stammered the young man, &#8220;to
know her name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yarnall swore. &#8220;Her name, as she gave it,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;is Jane. But, my boy, you can&#8217;t see her.
She left this morning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>Pierre raised a white, tense face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Left?&#8221; He turned as if he would run after
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. These people I&#8217;ve had here took her
away with them. That is, they&#8217;ve been urging
her to go, but she&#8217;d refused. Then, suddenly,
this morning, just as they were putting the
trunks in, up came Jane, white as chalk, asking
them to take her with them, said she must go.
Well, sir, they rigged her up with some traveling
clothes and drove away with her. That was six
hours ago. By now they&#8217;re in the train, bound
for New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yarnall&#8217;s guest looked at him without speaking,
and Yarnall nervously went on, &#8220;She&#8217;s been
with us about six months, Landis, and I don&#8217;t
know anything about her. She was tall, gray eyes,
black hair, slow speaking, and with the kind of
voice you&#8217;d be apt to notice ... yes, I see she&#8217;s
the girl you&#8217;ve been looking for. I can give you
the New York people&#8217;s address, but first, for
Jane&#8217;s sake,&mdash;I&#8217;m a pretty good friend of hers,
I think a lot of Jane,&mdash;I&#8217;ll have to know what
you want with her&mdash;what she is to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre&#8217;s pupils widened till they all but swallowed
the smoke-colored iris.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is my wife,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>Again Yarnall swore. But he lit a cigarette and
took his time about answering. &#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you must excuse me, but&mdash;it was because
she saw you, I take it, that Jane cut off this
morning. That&#8217;s clear. Now, I don&#8217;t know what
would make a girl run off from her husband. She
might have any number of reasons, bad and good,
but it seems to me that it would be a pretty
strong one that would make a girl run off, with
a look such as she wore, from a man like you.
Did you treat her well, Landis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It had the effect of a lash taken by a penitent.
The man shrank a little, whitened, endured. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t tell you how I treated her,&#8221; he said in a
dangerous voice; &#8220;it don&#8217;t bear tellin&#8217;. But&mdash;I
want her back. I was&mdash;I was&mdash;that was three
years ago; I am more like a man now. You&#8217;ll
give me the people&#8217;s name, their address?...&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre laid his hand on the older man&#8217;s wrist
and gave it a queer urgent and beseeching shake.
</p>
<p>After a moment of searching scrutiny, Yarnall
bent his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said he shortly; &#8220;come in.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LUCK&#8217;S PLAY</h3>
</div>

<p>A young man who had just landed in New
York from one of the big, adventurous
transatlantic liners hailed a taxicab and was
quickly drawn away into the glitter and gayety
of a bright winter morning. He sat forward
eagerly, looking at everything with the air of a
lad on a holiday. He was a young man, but he
was not in his first youth, and under a heavy
sunburn he was pale and a trifle worn, but there
was about him a look of being hard and very
much alive. Under a broad brow there were
hawk eyes of greenish gray, a delicate beak, a
mouth and chin of cleverness. It was an interesting
face and looked as though it had seen
interesting things. In fact, Prosper Gael had just
returned from his three months of ambulance
service in France, and it was the extraordinary
success of his play, &#8220;The Leopardess,&#8221; that had
chiefly brought him back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Luck,&#8221; his manager had written, using
the college title which Prosper&#8217;s name and unvarying
good fortune suggested, &#8220;you&#8217;d better
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
come back and gather up some of these laurels
that are smothering us all. The time is very
favorable for the disappearance of your anonymity.
I, for one, find it more and more difficult to
keep the secret. So far, not even your star knows
it. She calls you &#8216;Mr. Luck&#8217; ... to that extent
I have been indiscreet....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper had another letter in his pocket, a
letter that he had re-read many times, always
with an uneasy conflict of emotions. He was in a
sort of hot-cold humor over it, in a fever-fit that
had a way of turning into lassitude. He postponed
analysis indefinitely. Meanwhile his eyes
searched the bright, cold city, its crowds, its
traffics, its windows&mdash;most of all, its placards,
and, not far to seek, there were the posters of
&#8220;The Leopardess.&#8221; He leaned out to study one
of them; a tall, wild-eyed woman crouched to
spring upon a man who stared at her in fear.
Prosper dropped back with a gleaming smile of
amused excitement. &#8220;They&#8217;ve made it look like
cheap melodrama,&#8221; he said to himself; &#8220;and yet
it&#8217;s a good thing, the best thing I&#8217;ve ever done.
Yet they will vulgarize the whole idea with their
infernal notions of &#8216;what the public wants.&#8217;
Morena is as bad as the rest of them!&#8221; He expressed
disgust, but underneath he was aglow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
with pride and interest. &#8220;There&#8217;s a performance
to-night. I&#8217;ll dine with Jasper. I&#8217;ll have to see
Betty first....&#8221; His thoughts trailed off and he
fell into that hot-cold confusion, that uncomfortable
scorching fog of mood. The cab turned
into Fifth Avenue and became a scale in the
creeping serpent of vehicles that glided, paused,
and glided again past the thronged pavements.
Prosper contrasted everything with the grim
courage and high-pitched tragedy of France.
He could not but wonder at the detached frivolity
of these money-spenders, these spinners in
the sun. How soon would the shadow fall upon
them too and with what change of countenance
would they look up! To him the joyousness
seemed almost childish and yet he bathed his
fagged spirit in it. How high the white clouds
sailed, how blue was the midwinter sky! How
the buildings towered, how quickly the people
stepped! Here were the pretty painted faces, the
absurd silk stockings, the tripping, exquisitely
booted feet, the swinging walk, the tall, up-springing
bodies of the women he remembered.
He regarded them with impersonal delight, untinged
by any of his usual cynicism.
</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when Prosper, obedient
to a telephone call from Betty, presented himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
at the door of Morena&#8217;s house, just east of the
Park, off Fifth Avenue; a very beautiful house
where the wealthy Jew had indulged his passion
for exquisite things. Prosper entered its rich dimness
with a feeling of oppression&mdash;that unanalyzed
mood of hot and cold feeling intensified to
an almost unbearable degree. In the large carved
and curtained drawing-room he waited for Betty.
The tea-things were prepared; there would be no
further need of service until Betty should ring.
Everything was arranged for an uninterrupted
tête-à-tête. Prosper stood near an ebony table,
his shoulder brushed by tall, red roses, and felt
his nerves tighten and his pulses hasten in their
beat. &#8220;The tall child ... the tall child ...&#8221; he
had called her by that name so often and never
without a swift and stabbing memory of Joan,
and of Joan&#8217;s laughter which he had silenced.
</p>
<p>He took out the letter he had lately received
from Betty and re-read it and, as he read, a deep
line cut between his eyes. &#8220;You say you will not
come back unless I can give you more than I
have ever given you in the past. You say you
intend to cut yourself free, that I have failed you
too often, that you are starved on hope. I&#8217;m not
going to ask much more patience of you. I failed
you that first time because I lost courage; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
second time, fate failed us. How could I think
that Jasper would get well when the doctors told
me that I mustn&#8217;t allow myself even a shadow
of hope! Now, I think that Jasper, himself, is
preparing my release. This all sounds like something
in a book. That&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve hurt me.
I feel frozen up. I couldn&#8217;t bear it if now, just
when the door is opening, you failed me. Prosper,
you are my lover for always, aren&#8217;t you? I have
to believe that to go on living. You are the one
thing in my wretched life that hasn&#8217;t lost its
value. Now, read this carefully; I am going to be
brutal. Jasper has been unfaithful to me. I know
it. I have sufficient evidence to prove it in a law
court and I shall not hesitate to get a divorce.
Tear this up, please. Now, of all times, we must
be extraordinarily careful. There has never been
a whisper against us and there mustn&#8217;t be.
Jasper must not suspect. A counter-suit would
ruin my life. I must talk it over with you. I&#8217;ll see
you once alone&mdash;just once&mdash;before I leave
Jasper and begin the suit. We must have patience
for just this last bit. It will seem very long....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper folded the letter. He was conscious of
a faint feeling of sickness, of fear. Then he heard
Betty&#8217;s step across the marble pavement of the
hall. She parted the heavy curtains, drew them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
together behind her, and stood, pale with joy,
opening and shutting her big eyes. Then she came
to meet him, held him back, listening for any
sound that might predict interruption, and gave
herself to his arms. She was no longer pale when
he let her go. She went a few steps away and
stood with her hands before her face, then she
went to sit by the tea-table. They were both
flushed. Betty&#8217;s eyes were shining under their
fluttering lids. Prosper rejoiced in his own emotion.
The mental fog had lifted and the feeling of
faintness was gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve decided not to break away altogether,
then?&#8221; she asked, giving him a quick glance.
</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;Not if what you have
written me is true. I&#8217;ve had such letters from
you before and I&#8217;ve grown very suspicious. Are
you sure this time?&#8221; He laid stress upon his bitterness.
It was his one weapon against her and
he had been sharpening it with a vague purpose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Betty, speaking low and furtively,
&#8220;Jasper is fairly caught. I have a reliable witness
in the girl&#8217;s maid. There is no doubt of his guilt,
Prosper, none. Everyone is talking of it. He has
been perfectly open in his attentions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Every minute Betty looked younger and prettier,
more provoking. Her child-mouth with its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
clever smile was bright as though his kiss had
painted it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the girl?&#8221; asked Prosper. He was
deeply flushed. Being capable of simultaneous
points of view, he had been stung by that cool
phrase of Betty&#8217;s concerning &#8220;Jasper&#8217;s guilt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you in a moment. Did you destroy
my letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Prosper, please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took it out, tore it up, and walking over to
the open fire, burned the papers. He came back
to his tea. &#8220;Well, Betty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl,&#8221; said Betty, &#8220;is the star in your
play, &#8216;The Leopardess,&#8217; the girl that Jasper
picked up two Septembers ago out West. He has
written to you about her. She was a cook, if you
please, a hideous creature, but Jasper saw at
once what there was in her. She has made the
play. You&#8217;ll have to acknowledge that yourself
when you see her. She is wonderful. And, partly
owing to the trouble I&#8217;ve taken with her, the girl
is beautiful. One wouldn&#8217;t have thought it possible.
She is not charming to me, she&#8217;s not in the
least subtle. It&#8217;s odd that she should have had
such an effect upon Jasper, of all men....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper sipped his tea and listened. He looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
at her and was bitterly conscious that the excitement
which had pleased and surprised him was
dying out. That faintness again assailed his
spirit. He was feeling stifled, ashamed, bored.
Yes, that was it, bored. That life of service and
battle-danger in France had changed him more
than he had realized till now. He was more simple,
more serious, more moral, in a certain sense.
He was like a man who, having denied the existence
of Apollyon, has come upon him face to face
and has been burnt by his breath. Such a man is
inevitably moral. All this long, intricate intrigue
with the wife of a man who called him friend,
seemed to him horribly unworthy. If Betty had
been a great lover, if she had not lost courage at
the eleventh hour and left him to face that terrible
winter in Wyoming, then their passion might
have justified itself: but now there was a staleness
in their relationship. He hated the thought
of the long divorce proceedings, of the decent
interval, of the wedding, of the married life. He
had never really wanted that. And now, in the
ebb of his passion, how could he force himself to
take her when he had learned to live more keenly,
more completely without her! He would have
to take her, to spend his days and nights with
her, to travel with her. She would want to visit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
that gay, little forsaken house in a Wyoming
cañon. With vividness he saw a girl lying prone
on a black rug before a dancing fire, her hair all
fallen about her face, her secret eyes lifted impatiently
from the book&mdash;&#8220;You had ought to
be writin&#8217;, Mr. Gael....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you smiling for, Prosper?&#8221; Betty
asked sharply.
</p>
<p>He looked up, startled and confused. &#8220;Sorry.
I&#8217;ve got into beastly absent-minded habits. Is
that Morena?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper opened the curtains and came in, greeting
Prosper in his stately, charming fashion.
&#8220;To-night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll show you a leopardess
worth looking at, won&#8217;t we, Betty? But first you
must tell us about your own experience. You
look wonderfully fit, doesn&#8217;t he, Betty? And
changed. They say the life out there stamps a
man, and they&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s taken some of that
winged-demon look out of your face, Prosper,
put some soul into it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He talked and Betty laughed, showing not the
slightest evidence of effort, though the soul Jasper
had seen in Prosper&#8217;s face felt shriveled for
her treachery. Prosper wondered if she could be
right in her surmise about Jasper. The Jew was
infinitely capable of dissimulation, but there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
a clarity of look and smile that filled Prosper
with doubts. And the eyes he turned upon his
wife were quite as apparently as ever the eyes of
a disappointed man.
</p>
<p>So absorbed was he in such observations that
he found it intolerably difficult to fix his attention
on the talk. Jasper&#8217;s fluency seemed to ripple
senselessly about his brain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must consent to one thing, Luck: you
must allow me to choose my own time for announcing
the authorship.&#8221; This found its way
partially to his intelligence and he gave careless
assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, whenever you like, as soon as I&#8217;ve had
my fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;&#8221; Morena was thoughtful for an
instant. &#8220;How would it do for me to leave it with
Melton, the business manager? Eh? Suppose I
phone him and talk it over a little. He&#8217;ll want
to wait till toward the end of the run. He&#8217;s keen;
has just the commercial sense of the born advertiser.
Let him choose the moment. Then we can
feel sure of getting the right one. Will you,
Luck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you advise it. You ought to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;m so confoundedly busy, so many
irons in the fire, I might just miss the psychic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
moment. I think Melton&#8217;s the man&mdash;I&#8217;ll call
him up to-night before we leave. Then I won&#8217;t
forget it and I&#8217;ll be sure to catch him too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Prosper vaguely agreed and promptly
forgot that he had given his permission. Later,
there came an agonizing moment when he would
have given the world to recall his absent, careless
words.
</p>
<p>With an effort Prosper kept his poise, with an
effort, always increasing, he talked to Jasper
while Betty dressed, and kept up his end at dinner.
The muscles round his mouth felt tight and
drawn, his throat was dry. He was glad when
they got into the limousine and started theaterwards.
It had been a long time since he had
been put through this particular ordeal and he
was out of practice.
</p>
<p>They reached the house just as the lights went
out. Prosper was amused at his own intense
excitement. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was still such a
kid,&#8221; he said, flashing a smile, the first spontaneous
one he had given her, upon Betty who sat
beside him in the proscenium box.
</p>
<p>The success of his novel had had no such effect
upon him as this. It was entrancing to think that
in a few moments the words he had written would
come to him clothed in various voices, the people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
his brain had pictured would move before him in
flesh and blood, doing what he had ordained that
they should do. When the curtain rose, he had
forgotten his personal problem, had forgotten
Betty. He leaned forward, his elbows on his
knees, his chin in his hand.
</p>
<p>The scene was of a tropical island, palms, a
strip of turquoise sea. A girl pushed aside the
great fronds of ferns and stepped down to the
beach. At her appearance the audience broke
into applause. She was a tall girl, her stained legs
and arms bare below her ragged dress, her black
hair hung wild and free about her face and
neck. As the daughter of a native mother and
an English father, her beauty had been made
to seem both Saxon and savage. Stained and
painted, darkened below the great gray eyes,
Joan with her brows and her classic chin and
throat, Joan with her secret, dangerous eyes and
lithe, long body, made an arresting picture enough
against the setting of vivid green and blue. She
moved slowly, deliberately, naturally, and stood,
hands on hips, to watch a ship sail into the turquoise
harbor. It was not like acting, she seemed
really to look. She threw back her head and gave
a call. It was the name of her stage brother, but
it came from her deep chest and through her long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
column of a throat like music. Prosper brought
down his hands on the railing before him, half
pushed himself up, turned a blind look upon
Betty, who laid a restraining hand upon his arm.
</p>
<p>He whispered a name, which Betty could not
make out, then he sat down, moistened his lips
with his tongue, and sat through the entire first
act and neither moved nor spoke. As the curtain
went down he stood up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go out,&#8221; he said, and hesitated in the
back of the box till Jasper came over to him with
an anxious question. Then he began to stammer
nervously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell her, Jasper, don&#8217;t tell her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her what, man? Tell whom?&#8221; Jasper
gave him a shake. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you like Jane? Isn&#8217;t
she wonderful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, extraordinary!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Made for the part?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Prosper&#8217;s face twisted into a smile.
&#8220;No. The part came second, she was there first.
Morena, promise me you won&#8217;t tell her who wrote
the play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Prosper, suppose you tell me
what&#8217;s wrong. Have you seen a ghost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper laughed; then, seeing Betty, her face
a rigid question, he struggled to lay hands upon
his self-control.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Something very astonishing has happened,
Morena,&mdash;one of those &#8216;things not dreamt of in
a man&#8217;s philosophy.&#8217; I can&#8217;t tell you. Have you
arranged for me to meet Jane West?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After the show, yes, at supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But not as the author?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I was waiting for you to tell her that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She mustn&#8217;t know. And&mdash;and I can&#8217;t meet
her that way, at supper.&#8221; Again he made visible
efforts at self-control. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Betty what a
fool I am. I&#8217;ll go out a minute. I&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty was coming toward them. He gave a
painful smile and fled.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>JOAN AND PROSPER</h3>
</div>

<p>The situation was no doubt an extraordinary,
an unimaginable one, but it had to be met.
When he returned to the box, Prosper had himself
in hand, and, sitting a little farther back
than before, he watched the second act with a
sufficiency of outward calm.
</p>
<p>This part was the most severe test of his composure,
for he had fashioned it almost in detail
upon that idyll in a cañon. There were even
speeches of Joan&#8217;s that he had used. To sit here
and watch Joan herself go through it, while he
looked on, was an exciting form of torment. The
setting was different, tropical instead of Northern,
and the half-native heroine was more passionate,
more emotional, more animal than Joan. Nevertheless,
the drama was a repetition. As Prosper
had laid his trap for Joan, silently, subtly undermining
her whole mental structure, using her
loneliness, playing upon the artist soul of her, so
did this Englishman lay his trap for Zona. He
was more cruel than Prosper, rougher, necessarily
more dramatic, but there was all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
essence of the original drama, the ensnarement
of a simple, direct mind by a complex and skillful
one. Joan&#8217;s surrender, Prosper&#8217;s victory, were
there. He wondered how Joan could act it, play
the part in cold blood. Now he was condemned
to live in his own imagination through Joan&#8217;s
tragedy. There was that first pitifulness of a
tamed and broken spirit; then later, in London,
the agony of loneliness, of separation, of gradual
awakening to the change in her master&#8217;s heart.
Prosper had written the words, but it was Joan
who, with her voice, the music of memory-shaken
heart-strings, made the words alive and meaningful.
Others in the audience might wonder over
the girl&#8217;s ability to interpret this unusual experience,
to make it natural, human, inevitable. But
Prosper did not wonder. He knew that simply
she forced herself to re-live this most painful
part of her own life and to re-live it articulately.
What, in God&#8217;s name, had induced her to do it?
Necessity? Poverty? Morena? All at once he
remembered Betty&#8217;s belief, that Joan was the
manager&#8217;s mistress&mdash;his wild, beautiful Joan,
Joan the creation of his own wizardry. This
thought gave him such pain that he whitened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prosper,&#8221; murmured Betty, &#8220;you must tell
me what is wrong. Evidently your nerves are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
in bad shape. Is the excitement too much for
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is,&#8221; he said, avoiding her eyes and
moving stiff, white lips; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such
acting. I&mdash;I&mdash;Morena says he&#8217;ll let me see her
in her dressing-room afterwards. You see, Betty,
I&#8217;m badly shaken up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; drawled Betty, and looked at him
through narrowed lids, and she sat with this look
on her face and with her fingers locked, when
Prosper, not giving her further notice, followed
Morena out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jasper,&#8221;&mdash;Prosper held his friend back in
the middle of a passage that led to the dressing-rooms,&mdash;&#8220;I
want very particularly to see Miss
West alone. I am very much moved by her performance
and I want to tell her so. Also, I want
her to express herself naturally with no idea of
my being the author of the play and without the
presence of her manager. Will you just ask if she
will see a friend of yours&mdash;alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper smiled his subtle smile. &#8220;Of course,
Prosper. It&#8217;s all as clear as daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper did not notice the Jew&#8217;s intelligent
expression. He was too much absorbed in his own
excitement. In a moment he would be with Joan&mdash;Joan,
his love of winter nights!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Morena tapped upon a door. A maid half-opened
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Miss West, please, if she will see a
friend of Mr. Morena&#8217;s. Tell her I particularly
wish her to give him a private interview.&#8221; He
scribbled a line on a card and the maid took
it in.
</p>
<p>In five minutes, during which the two men
waited silently, she came back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss West will see your friend, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then I&#8217;ll take myself off. Prosper, will
you join Betty and me at supper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks. I&#8217;ll have my brief interview with
Miss West and then go home, if you&#8217;ll forgive
me. I&#8217;m about all in. New York&#8217;s too much for
a man just home from the front.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper laid his hand for a moment on Prosper&#8217;s
shoulder, smiled, shrugged, and turned away.
Prosper waited till his friend was out of sight and
hearing, then knocked and was admitted to the
dressing-room of Miss Jane West.
</p>
<p>She had not changed from the evening dress
she had worn in the last scene nor had she yet
got rid of her make-up. She was sitting in a narrow-backed
chair that had been turned away
from the dressing-table. The maid was putting
away some costumes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Prosper walked half across the room and
stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss West,&#8221; he said quietly.
</p>
<p>She stood up. The natural color left her face
ghastly with patches of paint and daubs of black.
She threw back her head and said, &#8220;Prosper!&#8221;
just above her breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go out, Henrietta.&#8221; This was spoken to the
maid in the voice of Jane the virago and
Henrietta fled.
</p>
<p>At sight of Joan, Prosper had won back instantly
his old poise, his old feeling of ascendancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan, Joan,&#8221; he said gently; &#8220;was ever anything
so strange? Why didn&#8217;t you let me know?
Why didn&#8217;t you answer my letters? Why didn&#8217;t
you take my money? I have suffered greatly
on your account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan laughed. Four years ago she would not
have been capable of this laugh, and Prosper
started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote again and again,&#8221; he said passionately.
&#8220;Wen Ho told me that you had gone, that
he didn&#8217;t know anything about your plans. I
went out to Wyoming, to our house. I scoured
the country for you. Did you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joan slowly, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that
But it makes no difference to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>They were still standing a few paces apart, too
intent upon their inner tumult to heed any outward
situation. She lowered her head in that
dangerous way of hers, looking up at him from
under her brows. Her color had returned and the
make-up had a more natural look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you did write, maybe you did send
money, maybe you did come back&mdash;I don&#8217;t care
anything for all that.&#8221; She made a gesture as if
to sweep something away. &#8220;The day after you
left me in that house, Pierre, my husband, came
up the trail. He was taking after me. He meant
to fetch me home. You told me&#8221;&mdash;she began
to tremble so violently that the jewels on her neck
clicked softly&mdash;&#8220;you told me he was <i>dead</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper came closer, she moving back, till,
striking the chair, she sat down on it and looked
up at him with her changed and embittered eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have gone back to him, Joan
Landis, after he had tied you up and branded
your shoulder with his cattlebrand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has that got to do with it?&#8221; she asked,
her voice lifting on a wave of anger. &#8220;That was
between my man and me. That was not for you
to judge. He loved me. It was through loving me
too much, too ignorantly, that he hurt me so.&#8221;
She choked. &#8220;But you&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Joan,&#8221; said Prosper, and he laid his hand on
her cold and rigid fingers, &#8220;I loved you too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was still and stiff. After a long silence she
seemed to select one question from a tide of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you leave me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote you a full explanation. The letter
came back to me unread.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Joan gave the laugh and the gesture of
disdain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter ... your loving or not
loving. You made use of me for your own ends,
and when you saw fit, you left me. But that&#8217;s
not my complaint. I don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t deserve
that. I was easy to use. But it was all based on
what wasn&#8217;t true. I was married, my man was
living, and I had dealings with you. That was sin.
That was horrible. That was what my mother
did. She was a &mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Joan used the coarse and
ugly word her father had taught her, and Prosper
laid a hand over her mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan! No! Never say it, never think it. You
are clean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan twisted herself free, stood up, and walked
away. &#8220;I am <i>that</i>!&#8221; she said grimly; &#8220;and it was
you that made me. You took lots of trouble to
make me see things in a way where nothing a
person wants is either right or wrong. You made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
me thirsty with your talk and your books and
your music, and when I was tormented with
thirst, you came and offered me a drink of water.
That was it. I don&#8217;t care about your not marrying
me. I still don&#8217;t see that that has much to do
with it except, perhaps, that a man would be
caring to give any woman he rightly loves whatever
help or cherishing or gifts the world has decided
to give her. But, you see, Prosper, we didn&#8217;t
start fair. You knew that Pierre was alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Joan, you say yourself that marrying&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped him with so fierce a gesture that
he flinched. &#8220;Yes. Pierre did rightly love me.
He gave me his best as he knew it. Oh, he was
ignorant, a savage, I guess, like I was. But he did
rightly love me. He was not trying to break my
spirit nor to tame me, nor to amuse himself with
me, nor to give me a longing for beauty and easiness
and then leave me to fight through my own
rough life without any of those things. Did you
really think, Prosper Gael, that I would stay in
your house and live on your money till you should
be caring to come back to me&mdash;if ever you would
care? Did you honestly think that you would be
coming back&mdash;as&mdash;as my lover? No. Whatever
it was that took you away, it was likely to
keep you from me for always, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Prosper in a muffled voice, &#8220;it
was likely to. But, Joan, Fate was on your side.
Since I have been yours, I haven&#8217;t belonged to
any one but you. You&#8217;ve put your brand on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear about you,&#8221; Joan broke
in. &#8220;I am done with you. Have you seen this
play?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; He found that in telling her so he could
not meet her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the man who wrote that knew what
you are, and, if he didn&#8217;t, every one that has
seen me act in it, knows what you are.&#8221; She
paused, breathing fast and trembling. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>He went vaguely toward the door, then threw
up his head defiantly. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s not
going to be good-bye. I&#8217;ve found you. You must
let me tell you the truth about myself. Come,
Joan, you&#8217;re as just as Heaven. You never read
my explanations. You&#8217;ve never heard my side of
it. You&#8217;ll let me come to see you and you&#8217;ll hear
me out. Don&#8217;t do me an injustice. I&#8217;ll leave the
whole thing in your hands after that. But you
must give me that one chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chance?&#8221; repeated Joan. &#8220;Chance for what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221;&mdash;Prosper flung up his lithe, long
hands&mdash;&#8220;oh, for nothing but a cleansing in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
your sight. I want what forgiveness I can wring
from you. I want what understanding I can
force from you. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She thought, standing there, still and tall, her
arms hanging, her eyes wide and secret, as he
had remembered them in her thin, changed, so
much more expressive face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you may come. I&#8217;ll
hear you out.&#8221; She gave him the address and
named an afternoon hour. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a graceful and dignified dismissal.
Prosper bit his lip, bowed and left her.
</p>
<p>As the door closed upon her, he knew that it
had closed upon the only real and vivid presence
in his life. War had burnt away his glittering,
clever frivolity. Betty was the adventure, Betty
was the tinsel; Joan was the grave, predestined
woman of his man. For the first time in his life
he found himself face to face with the cleanness
of despair.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>
</div>

<p>Joan waited for Prosper on the appointed
afternoon. There was a fire on her hearth and
a March snow-squall tapped against the window
panes. The crackle of the logs inside and that
eerie, light sound outside were so associated with
Prosper that, even before he came, Joan, sitting
on one side of the hearth, closed her eyes and felt
that he must be opposite to her in his red-lacquered
chair, his long legs stuck out in front, his
amused and greedy eyes veiled by a cloud of
cigarette smoke.
</p>
<p>Since she had seen him at the theater, she had
been suffering from sleeplessness. At night she
would go over and over the details of their intercourse,
seeing them, feeling them, living them in
the light of later knowledge, till the torment was
hardly to be borne. Three days and nights of this
inner activity had brought back that sharp line
between her brows and the bitter tightening of
her lips.
</p>
<p>This afternoon she was white with suspense.
Her dread of the impending interview was like a
physical illness. She sat in a high-backed chair,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
hands along the arms, head resting back, eyes
half-closed, in that perfect stillness of which the
animal and the savage are alone entirely capable.
There were many gifts that Joan had brought
from the seventeen years on Lone River. This
grave immobility was one. She was very carefully
dressed in a gown that accentuated her height
and dignity. And she wore a few jewels. She
wanted, pitifully enough, to mark every difference
between this Joan and the Joan whom
Prosper had drawn on his sled up the cañon
trail. If he expected to force her back into the
position of enchanted leopardess, to see her &#8220;lie
at his feet and eat out of his hand,&#8221; as Morena
had once described the plight of Zona, he would
see at a glance that she was no longer so easily
mastered. In fact, sitting there, she looked as
proud and perilous as a young Medea, black-haired
with long throat and cold, malevolent
lips. It was only in the eyes&mdash;those gray, unhappy,
haunted eyes&mdash;that Joan gave away
her eternal simplicity of heart. They were unalterably
tender and lonely and hurt. It was the
look in them that had prompted Shorty&#8217;s description,
&#8220;She&#8217;s plumb movin&#8217; to me&mdash;looks
about halfway between &#8216;You go to hell&#8217; and &#8216;You
take me in your arms to rest.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Prosper was announced, and Joan, keeping her
stillness, merely turned her head toward him as
he came into the room.
</p>
<p>She saw his rapid observation of the room, of
her, even before she noticed the very apparent
change in him. For he, too, was haggard and utterly
serious as she did not remember him. He
stood before her fire and asked her jerkily if she
would let him smoke. She said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and those
were the only words spoken for five unbearable
minutes the seconds of which her heart beat out
like a shaky hammer in some worn machine.
</p>
<p>Prosper smoked and stood there looking, now
at her, now at the fire. At last, with difficulty,
he smiled. &#8220;You are not going to make it easy
for me, are you, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For her part she was not looking at him. She
kept her eyes on the fire and this averted look
distressed and irritated his nerves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not trying to make it hard,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;I want you to say what you came to say and
go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did <i>you</i> ever love me, Joan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had said it to force a look from her, but it
had the effect only of making her more still, if
possible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said slowly, answering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
with her old directness. &#8220;I thought you needed
me. I was alone. I was scared of the emptiness
when I went out and looked down the valley.
I thought Pierre had gone out of the world and
there was no living thing that wanted me. I came
back and you met me and you put your arms
round me and you said&#8221;&mdash;she closed her eyes
and repeated his speech as though she had just
heard it&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t leave me, Joan.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice was more than ever before moving
and expressive. Prosper felt that half-forgotten
thrill. The muscles of his throat contracted.
&#8220;Joan, I did want you. I spoke the truth,&#8221; he
pleaded.
</p>
<p>She went on with no impatience but very
coldly. &#8220;You came to tell me your side. Will you
tell me, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the first time she looked into his eyes and
he drew in his breath at the misery of hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I built that cabin, Joan,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for another
woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wife?&#8221; asked Joan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the one I said must have been like a tall
child? She wasn&#8217;t your wife? She was dead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper shook his head. &#8220;No. Did you think
that? She was a woman I loved at that time very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
dearly and she was already married to another
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You built that house for her? I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She had promised to leave her husband and
to come away with me. I had everything ready,
those rooms, those clothes, those materials, and
when I went out to get her, I had a message saying
that her courage had failed her, that she
wouldn&#8217;t come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a better woman than me,&#8221; said Joan
bitterly.
</p>
<p>Prosper laughed. &#8220;By God, she was not! She
sent me down to hell. I couldn&#8217;t go back to the
East again. I had laid very careful and elaborate
plans. I was trapped out there in that horrible
winter country....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not horrible,&#8221; said Joan violently; &#8220;it
was the most wonderful, beautiful country in all
the world.&#8221; And tears ran suddenly down her
face.
</p>
<p>But she would not let him come near to comfort
her. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; she said presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you came, Joan,&#8221; Prosper went on,
&#8220;it was horrible. It was like being starved. Every
thing in the house reminded me of&mdash;her. I had
planned it all very carefully and we were to have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
been&mdash;happy. You can fancy what it was to be
there alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan nodded. She <i>was</i> just and she was honestly
trying to put herself in his place. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;if I had gone back and Pierre had
been dead, his homestead would have been like
that to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was because I was so miserable that I went
out to hunt. I&#8217;d scour the country all day and
half the night to tire myself out, that I could get
some sleep. I was pretty far from home that moonlight
night when I heard you scream for help....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan&#8217;s face grew whiter. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell about
that,&#8221; she pleaded.
</p>
<p>He paused, choosing another opening. &#8220;After
I had bandaged you and told you that Pierre
was dead&mdash;and I honestly thought he was&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t know what to do with you. You couldn&#8217;t
be left, and there was no neighbor nearer than
my own house; besides, I had shot a man, and,
perhaps,&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, maybe I was influenced
by your beauty, by my own crazy loneliness....
You were very beautiful and very desolate.
I was in a fury over the brute&#8217;s treatment
of you....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Joan; &#8220;you are not to talk
about Pierre.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Prosper shrugged. &#8220;I decided to take you
home with me. I wanted you desperately, just,
I believe, to take care of, just to be kind to&mdash;truly,
Joan, I was lonely to the point of madness.
Some one to care for, some one to talk to,
was absolutely necessary to save my reason. So
when I was leading you out, I&mdash;I saw Pierre&#8217;s
hand move&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan stood up. After a moment she controlled
herself with an effort and sat down again. &#8220;Go
on. I can stand it,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I thought to myself, &#8216;The devil is alive
and he deserves to be dead. This woman can
never live with him again. God wouldn&#8217;t sanction
such an act as giving her back to his hands.&#8217;
And I was half-mad myself, I&#8217;d been alone so
long ... I stood so you couldn&#8217;t see him, Joan,
and I threw an elk-hide over him and led you
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed you; I didn&#8217;t look at Pierre; I
left him lying there,&#8221; gasped Joan.
</p>
<p>Prosper went on monotonously. &#8220;When I came
back a week later, I thought he would be dead.
It was dusk, the wind was blowing, the snow was
driving in a scud. I came down to the cabin and
dropped below the drift by that northern window,
and, the second I looked in, I dropped out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
of sight. There was a light and a fire. Your husband
was lying before the fire on a cot. There
was another man there, your Mr. Holliwell; they
were talking, Holliwell was dressing Pierre&#8217;s
wound. I went away like a ghost, and while I
was going back, I thought it all out; and I decided
to keep you for myself. I suppose,&#8221; said
Prosper dully, &#8220;that that was a horrible sin. I
didn&#8217;t see it that way then. I&#8217;m not sure I see
it that way now. Pierre had tied you up and
pressed a white-hot iron into your bare shoulder.
If you went back to him, if he took you back,
how was I to know that he might not repeat his
drunken deviltry, or do worse, if anything could
be worse! It was the act of a fiend. It put him out
of court with me. Whatever I gave you, education
and beauty, and ease, must be better and
happier for you than life with such a brute as
Pierre&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Joan between her teeth; &#8220;you
know nothing of Pierre and me; you only know
that one dreadful night. You don&#8217;t know&mdash;the
rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know the rest,&#8221; he said
sharply; &#8220;that is enough to justify my action.
I thought so then and I think so now. You won&#8217;t
be able to make me change that opinion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not try,&#8221; said Joan.
</p>
<p>He accepted this and went on. &#8220;When I found
you in your bed waiting for news of Pierre, I
thought you the most beautiful, pitiful thing
I had ever seen. I loved you then, Joan, then.
Tell me, did I ever in those days hurt you or
give you a moment&#8217;s anxiety or fear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Joan admitted, &#8220;you did not. In those
days you were wonderful, kind and patient with
me. I thought you were more like God than a
human then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper laughed with bitterness. &#8220;You thought
very wrong, but, according to my own lights, I
was very careful of you. I meant to give you all I
could and I meant to win you with patience and
forbearance. I had respect for you and for your
grief and for the horrible thing you had suffered.
Joan, by now you know better what the world is.
Can you reproach me so very bitterly for our&mdash;happiness,
even if it was short?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You lied to me,&#8221; said Joan. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just.
We didn&#8217;t start even. And&mdash;and you knew
what you wanted of me. I never guessed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t? You never guessed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Sometimes, toward the last, I was afraid.
I felt that I ought to go away. That day I ran off&mdash;you
remember&mdash;I was afraid of you. I felt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
you were bad and that I was bad too. Then it
seemed to me that I&#8217;d been dreadfully ungrateful
and unkind. That was what began to make
me give way to my feelings. I was sorrowful because
I had hurt you and you so kind! The day I
came in with that suit and spoke of&mdash;her as a
&#8216;tall child&#8217; and you cried, why, I felt so sorrowful
that I&#8217;d made you suffer. I wanted to comfort
you, to put my hands on you in comfort, like a
mother, I felt. And you went out like you were
angry and stayed away all night as though you
couldn&#8217;t bear to be seeing me again in your
house that you had built for her. So I wrote you
my letter and went away. And then&mdash;it was all
so awful cold and empty. I didn&#8217;t know Pierre
was out there. I came back....&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were both silent for a long time and in
the silence the idyll was re-lived. Spring came
again with its crest of green along the cañon and
the lake lay like a turquoise drawing the glittering
peak down into its heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My book&mdash;its success,&#8221; Prosper began at
last, &#8220;made me restless. You&#8217;ll understand that
now that you are an artist yourself. And one
day there came a letter from that woman I had
loved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a little square gray envelope,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Joan breathlessly. &#8220;I can see it now. You never
rightly looked at me again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Prosper. He turned and hid his
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the rest,&#8221; said Joan.
</p>
<p>He went on without turning back to her, his
head bent. &#8220;The woman wrote that her husband
was dying, that I must come back to her at
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The snow tapped and the fire crackled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you&mdash;went back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her husband did not die,&#8221; said Prosper
blankly; &#8220;he is still alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you still love her very much?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the worst of it, Joan,&#8221; groaned
Prosper. His groan changed into a desperate
laugh. &#8220;I love you. Now truly I do love you. If
I could marry you&mdash;if I could have you for my
wife&mdash;&#8221; He waited, breathing fast, then came
and stood close before her. &#8220;I have never wanted
a woman to be my wife till now. I want you.
I want you to be the mother of my children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Joan did look at him with all her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Pierre&#8217;s wife,&#8221; she said. The liquid
beauty had left her voice. It was hoarse and dry.
&#8220;I am Pierre&#8217;s wife and I have already been the
mother of your child.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>There was a long, rigid silence. &#8220;Joan&mdash;when?&mdash;where?&#8221;
Prosper&#8217;s throat clicked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it before you left. I couldn&#8217;t tell you
because you were so changed. I worked all winter.
It&mdash;it was born on an awful cold March night.
I think the woman let it&mdash;made it&mdash;die. She
wanted me to work for her during the summer
and she thought I would be glad if the child
didn&#8217;t live. She used to say I was &#8216;in trouble&#8217;
and she&#8217;d be glad if she could &#8216;help me out.&#8217;...
It was what I was planning to live for ... that
child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the heavy stillness following Joan&#8217;s
dreadful, brief account of birth and death, Prosper
went through a strange experience. It seemed
to him that in his soul something was born and
died. Always afterwards there was a ghost in
him&mdash;the father that might have been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk any more,&#8221; said Joan faintly.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please go?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AGAINST THE BARS</h3>
</div>

<p>Jasper Morena had stood for an hour in a
drafty passage of that dirty labyrinth known
vaguely to the public as &#8220;behind the scenes,&#8221;
listening to the wearisome complaints of a long-nosed
young actor. It was the sixth of such conversations
that he had held that day: to begin
with, there had been a difficulty between a director
and the leading man. Morena&#8217;s tact was
still complete; he was very gentle to the long-nosed
youth; but the latter, had he been capable
of seeing anything but himself, must have
noticed that his listener&#8217;s face was pale and
faintly lined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy, of course, that&#8217;s reasonable
enough. I&#8217;ll do what I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t make extravagant demands, you see,&#8221;
the young man spread down and out his hands,
quivering with exaggerated feeling; &#8220;I ask only
for decent treatment, what my own self-respect
ab-so-lute-ly demands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morena put a hand on his shoulder and walked
beside him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever stop to think,&#8221; he said with his
charming smile, &#8220;that the other fellow is thinking
and saying just the same thing? Now, this
chap that has, as you put it, got your goat,
why, he came to me himself this morning, and,
word for word, he said of you just precisely
what you have just said of him to me. Odd,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the young actor stopped for one of his
gestures, hands up this time. &#8220;But, my God, sir!
Is there such a thing as honesty? He couldn&#8217;t
accuse me of&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he thought he could. However, I do get
your point of view and I think we can fix it up
for you so that you&#8217;ll get off with your self-respect
entirely intact. I&#8217;ll talk to George to-morrow.
You&#8217;re worth the bother. Good-afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man bowed, his air of tragic injury
softened to one of tragic self-appreciation. Worth
the bother, indeed!
</p>
<p>Morena left him at the top of the dingy stairs
down which the manager fled to an alley at one
side of the theater, where his car was waiting for
him. He stood for a while with his foot on the
step and his hand on the door, looking rather
blankly at the gray, cold wall and the scurrying
whirlwinds of dust and paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Drop yourself at the garage, Ned,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll take the car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He climbed in beside the wheel. He was very
tired, but he had remembered that Jane West,
when he had last seen her, had worn a look of
profound discouragement. She never complained,
but when he saw that particular expression he
was frightened and the responsibility for her
came heavily upon him. This wild thing he had
brought to New York must not be allowed to
beat its head dumbly against the bars.
</p>
<p>When he had got rid of his driver, he turned
the car northward, and a few minutes later
Mathilde, the French maid chosen by Betty,
opened Jane&#8217;s door to him.
</p>
<p>While he took off his coat he looked along the
hall and saw its owner sitting, her chin propped
on a latticework of fingers. She was gazing out
of the window. It was a beautiful, desperate silhouette;
something fateful in the long, still pose
and the fixed look. She was still dressed in street
clothes as when she had left the theater, a blouse
and skirt of dark gray, very plain. Her figure,
now that it was trained to slight corseting, was
less vigorous and more fine-drawn. She was very
thin, but she had lost her worn and haggard look;
the premature hard lines had almost disappeared;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
a softer climate, proper care, rest, food, luxury
had given back her young, clear skin and the
brightness of eyes and lips. Her hair, arranged
very simply to frame her face in a broken setting
of black, was glossy, and here and there, deeply
waved. It was the arrangement chosen for her
by Betty and copied from a Du Maurier drawing
of the Duchess of Towers. It was hard to believe
that this graceful woman was the virago Jane,
harder for any one that had seen a heavy, handsome
girl stride into Mrs. Upper&#8217;s hotel and ask
for work, to believe that she was here.
</p>
<p>Morena clapped his hands in the Eastern fashion
of summons, and Jane looked toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strolled in and stood beside her shaking
his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like the look of you this afternoon,
my dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the look
of you either.&#8221; She smiled her slow, unself-conscious
smile. &#8220;You sit down and I&#8217;ll make
tea for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew that thought for some one else was
the best tonic for her mood, so he dropped, with
his usual limp grace, into the nearest chair, put
back his head and half-closed his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used up,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a word&mdash;not
one to throw at a dog.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t throw one at me, then. I surely
wouldn&#8217;t take it as a compliment.&#8221; She made
the tea gravely, as absorbed in the work as a
little girl who makes tea for her dolls. She
brought him his cup and went back to her place
and again her face settled into that look. She had
evidently forgotten him and her eyes held a
vision as of distances.
</p>
<p>He put a hand up to break her fixed gaze.
&#8220;What is it, Jane? What do you see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>To his astonishment she hid her face in her
hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s awful to live like this,&#8221; she moaned;
and it frightened him to see her move her head
from side to side like an imprisoned beast, shifting
before bars.
</p>
<p>He looked about the pretty room and repeated,
&#8220;Like this?&#8221; half-reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate it!&#8221; She spoke through her teeth. &#8220;I
hate it! And, oh, the sounds, the noises, grinding
into your ears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here the hands came to her ears and framed a
white, desperate face in which the lids had fallen
over sick eyes.
</p>
<p>Jasper sat listening to the hum and roar and
clatter of the street. To him it was a pleasant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
sound, and here it was subdued and remote
enough. Her face was like that of some one maddened
by noise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t smell anything fresh&#8221;&mdash;her chest
lifted&mdash;&#8220;you don&#8217;t get air. I can&#8217;t breathe.
Everything presses in.&#8221; She opened her eyes,
bright and desperate. &#8220;What am I doing here,
Mr. Morena?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had put down his cup quietly, for he was
really half-afraid of her. &#8220;Why did you come,
Jane?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I was afraid of some one. I was running
away, Mr. Morena. There&#8217;s some one that
mustn&#8217;t ever find me now, and to run away from
him&mdash;that was the business of my life. And it
kept my heart full of him and the dread of his
coming. You see, that was my happiness. I hoped
he was taking after me so&#8217;s I could run away.&#8221;
She laughed apologetically. &#8220;Does that sound
crazy to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I think I understand. And here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never come here. He&#8217;ll never find me.
It&#8217;s been four years. And I&#8217;m so changed.
This&#8221;&mdash;she gave herself a downward look&mdash;&#8220;this
isn&#8217;t the &#8216;gel&#8217; he wants.... Probably by
now he&#8217;s given me up. Maybe he&#8217;s found another.
Everything that&#8217;s bad and hateful can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
find me out here. Bad things can find you out
and try to clutch after you anywheres. But when
something wild and clean comes hunting for you,
something out of the big lonely places&mdash;why, it
would be scared to follow into this city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lonely, Jane. I&#8217;ve told you a hundred
times that you ought to make friends for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care for that. I don&#8217;t want friends,
not many friends. These acting people, they&#8217;re
not real folks. I don&#8217;t savvy their ways and they
don&#8217;t savvy mine. They always end by disliking
me because I&#8217;m queer and different from them.
You have been my friend, and your wife&mdash;that
is, she used to be.&#8221; Suddenly Jane became more
her usual self and spoke with childlike wistfulness.
&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t come to see me any more,
Mr. Morena. And I could love her. She&#8217;s so like
a little girl with those round eyes&mdash;&#8221; Jane held
up two circles made by forefingers and thumbs
to represent Betty&#8217;s round eyes. &#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; she
said; &#8220;isn&#8217;t she awfully winning? Seems as if
you must be taking care of her. She&#8217;s so small
and fine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper laughed with some bitterness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t like me now,&#8221; sighed Jane, but
the feelings Betty had hurt were connected with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
a later development so that they turned her
mood and brought her to a more normal dejection.
She was no longer a caged beast, she had
temporarily forgotten her bars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; said Jasper doubtfully.
&#8220;Betty does like you. She&#8217;s merely busy
and preoccupied. I&#8217;ve been neglected myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jane gave him a far too expressive look. It was
as though she had said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t fancy that
she cares for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper flushed and blinked his long, Oriental
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you haven&#8217;t a lover, Jane,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>She had walked over to the window, and his
speech, purposely a trifle cruel and insulting, did
not make her turn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re angry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;d better go
home. I&#8217;m not in good humor myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At which he laughed his murmuring, musical
laugh and prepared to leave her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of courage,&#8221; he said, getting
into his coat, &#8220;to bring a wild-cat here,
chain her up, and tease her&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you have me chained?&#8221; Her tone
was enraged and scornful. &#8220;I can snap your
flimsy little tether and go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>She wheeled upon him. She looked tall and
fierce and free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he cried with deprecating voice and
gesture. &#8220;You are making Mr. Luck&#8217;s fortune
and mine, not to mention your own. You mustn&#8217;t
break your chains. Get used to them. We all have
to, you know. It&#8217;s much the best method.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never get used to this life, never. It
just&mdash;somehow&mdash;isn&#8217;t mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps when you meet Mr. Luck, he&#8217;ll be
able to reconcile you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her expressive face darkened. &#8220;When shall I
meet Mr. Luck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon, I hope. Mr. Melton knows just when
to announce the authorship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate Mr. Luck more than any one in the
world,&#8221; she said in a low, quiet voice.
</p>
<p>Jasper stared. &#8220;Hate him! Why, in the name
of savagery, should you hate him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t explain. But you&#8217;d better keep
us apart. How came he to write &#8216;The Leopardess&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall leave him to tell you that. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>GRAY ENVELOPES</h3>
</div>

<p>It was with more than the usual sinking of heart
that Jasper let himself that evening into the
beautiful house which Betty and he called their
home. Joan&#8217;s too expressive look had stung the
old soreness of his disillusionment. He knew that
the house was empty of welcome. He took off his
hat and coat dejectedly. There were footsteps of
his man who came from the far end of the hall.
</p>
<p>While he stood waiting, Jasper noticed the
absence of a familiar fragrance. For the first time
in years Betty had forgotten to order flowers.
The red roses which Jasper always caressed with
a long, appreciative finger as he went by the
table in the hall, were missing. Their absence
gave him a faint sensation of alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kane, Mrs. Morena&#8217;s brother, has called
to see you, sir. He is waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper&#8217;s eyebrows rose. &#8220;To see me? Is he with
Mrs. Morena now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Mrs. Morena went out this morning
and has not yet returned. Mr. Kane has been
here since five o&#8217;clock, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a mechanical speech of dismissal. The
footman went off. Jasper stood tapping his chin
with his finger. Woodward Kane come to see him
during Betty&#8217;s absence! Woodward had not
spoken more than three or four icy words of
necessity to him since the marriage. After a stiff,
ungracious fashion this brother had befriended
Betty, but to his Jewish brother-in-law he had
shown only a slightly disguised distaste. The Jew
was well used to such a manner. He treated it
with light bitterness, but he did not love to receive
the users of it in his own house. It was with
heightened color and bent brows that he pushed
apart the long, crimson hangings and came into
the immense drawing-room.
</p>
<p>It was softly lighted and pleasantly warmed.
A fire burned. The tall, fair visitor rose from a
seat near the blaze and turned all in one rigid
piece toward his advancing host. Jasper was perfectly
conscious that his own gesture and speech
of greeting were too eager, too ingratiating, that
they had a touch of servility. He hated them
himself, but they were inherited with his blood,
as instinctive as the wagging of a dog&#8217;s tail. They
were met by a precise bow, no smile, no taking
of his outstretched hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>Jasper drew himself up at once, put the
slighted hand on the back of a tall, crimson-damask
chair, and looked his stateliest and most
handsome self.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty hasn&#8217;t come in yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been waiting for her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Woodward Kane pulled at his short, yellow
mustache and stared at Jasper with his large,
blank, blue eyes. &#8220;As a matter of fact I didn&#8217;t
call to see my sister, but to see you. I have just
come from Elizabeth. She is at my house. She
came to me this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper&#8217;s fingers tightened on the chair. &#8220;She is
sick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; There was a pause during which the
blank, blue eyes staring at him slowly gathered
a look of cold pleasure. Jasper was aware that
this man who hated him was enjoying his present
mission.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we sit down? I shall have to take a good
deal of your time, I am afraid. There is rather a
good deal to be gone over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper sat down in the chair the back of which
he had been holding. &#8220;Will you smoke?&#8221; he
asked, and smiled his charming smile.
</p>
<p>There was now not a trace of embarrassment,
anger, or anxiety about him. His eyes were quiet,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
his voice flexible. Woodward declined to smoke,
crossed his beautifully clothed legs and drew a
small gray envelope from his pocket. Jasper&#8217;s
eyes fastened upon it at once. It was Betty&#8217;s
paper and her angular, boyish writing marched
across it. Evidently the note was addressed to
him. He waited while Woodward turned it about
in his long, stiff, white fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About two months ago Betty came to me
one evening in great distress of mind. She asked
for my advice and to the best of my ability I gave
it to her. I wish that she had asked for it ten
years ago. She might have saved herself a great
deal. This time she has not only asked for it, but
she has been following it, and, in following it,
she has now left your house and come to mine.
This, of course, will not surprise you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does, however, surprise me greatly.&#8221; It
was still the gentle murmur, but Jasper&#8217;s cigarette
smoke veiled his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand that. However, it&#8217;s not
my business. Betty has asked me to interview
you to-day so that she may be spared the humiliation.
After this, you must address your communications
to her lawyers. In a short time
Rogers and Daring will serve you with notice of
divorce.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>Jasper sat perfectly still, leaning slightly forward,
his cigarette between his fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o!&#8221; he said after a long silence. Then he
held out his hand. &#8220;I may have Betty&#8217;s letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Woodward Kane withheld it and again that
look of pleasure was visible in his eyes. &#8220;Just a
moment, please. I should like to have my own
say out first. I shall have to be brutal, I am
afraid. In these matters there is nothing for it
but frankness. Your infidelity has been common
talk for some time. The story of it first came to
Betty&#8217;s ears on the evening when she came to me
two months ago. Since then there has been but
one possible course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper kept another silence, more difficult,
however, than his last. His pallor was noticeable.
&#8220;You say my&mdash;infidelity is common talk.
There has been a name used?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your protégée from Wyoming&mdash;Jane West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper was on his feet, and Woodward too rose,
jerkily holding up a hand. &#8220;No excitement,
please,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;Let us conduct this unfortunate
interview like gentlemen, if possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper laughed. &#8220;As you say&mdash;if possible.
Why, man, it was Betty who helped me bring
Miss West to New York, it was Betty who helped
me to install her here, it was Betty who chose the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
furnishings for her apartment, who helped her
buy her clothes, who engaged her maid, who
gave her most of her training. This is the most
preposterous, the most filthy perversion of the
truth. Betty must know it better than any one
else. Come, now, Woodward, there&#8217;s something
more in it than this?&#8221; Jasper had himself in
hand, but it was easy now to see the effort it
cost him. The veins of his forehead were swollen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not discuss the matter with you.
Betty has excellent evidence, unimpeachable
witnesses. There is no doubt in my mind, nor in
the minds of her lawyers, that she will win her
suit and get her divorce, her release. Of course,
you will not contest&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper stopped in his pacing which had begun
to take the curious, circling, weaving form characteristic
of him, and, standing now with his
head thrown back, he spoke sonorously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you imagine for one instant, Kane,&mdash;does
Betty imagine for one instant,&mdash;that I
shall not contest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This changed the look of cold pleasure in
Woodward&#8217;s eyes, which grew blank again. &#8220;Do
you mean me to understand&mdash;Naturally, I
took it for granted that you would act as most
gentlemen act under the circumstances.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have taken too much for granted,
you and Betty. Ten years ago your sister gave
herself to me. She is mine. I will not for a whim,
for a passion, for a temporary alienation, let her
go. Neither will I have my good name and the
name of a good woman besmirched for the sake
of this impertinent desire for a release. I love my
wife&#8221;&mdash;his voice was especially Hebraic and
especially abhorrent to the other&mdash;&#8220;and as a
husband I mean to keep her from the ruin this
divorce would mean to her&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Far from being her ruin, Morena, it would
be the saving of her. Her ruin was as nearly as
possible brought about ten years ago, when
against the advice, against the wishes of every
one who loved her, she made her insane marriage
with an underbred, commercial, and licentious
Jew. She was seventeen and you seized your
opportunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper had stepped close. He was a head taller
and several inches broader of shoulder than his
brother-in-law. &#8220;As long as you are in my house,
don&#8217;t insult me. I am, as you say, a Jew, and I am,
as you say, of a commercial family. But I am
not, I have never been licentious. Is it necessary
to use such language? You suggested that this
interview be conducted by us like gentlemen.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The man who refuses to give her liberty to
a wife that loathes him, scarcely comes under
the definition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My ideas on the matter are different. We
need not discuss them. If you will let me read
my wife&#8217;s letter, I think that we can come to an
end of this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Woodward unwillingly surrendered the small,
gray envelope to a quivering, outstretched hand.
Jasper turned away and stood near the lamp.
But his excitement prevented him from reading.
The angular writing jumped before his eyes. At
last, the words straightened themselves.
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>I am glad that you have given me this opportunity
to escape from a life that for a long time has been
dreadful to me. Ten years ago I made a disaster of
my life and yours. Forgive me if you can and let me
escape. I will not see you again. Whatever you may
have to say, please say it to Woodward. From now
on he is my protector. In other matters there are my
lawyers. It is absolutely not to be thought of that I
should speak to you. I hope never to see you alone.
I want you to hate me and this note ought to make it
easy for you.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Betty</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Jasper stared at the name. He was utterly bewildered,
utterly staggered, by the amazing dissimulation
practiced by this small, soft-lipped,
round-eyed girl who had lived with him for so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
long, sufficiently pliable, sufficiently agreeable.
What was back of it all? Another man, of course.
In imagination he was examining the faces of his
acquaintances, narrowing his lids as though the
real men passed in review before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you understand the situation better
now?&#8221; asked Woodward cruelly.
</p>
<p>Jasper&#8217;s intense pain and humiliation gave him
a sort of calm. He seemed entirely cool when he
moved back toward his brother-in-law; his eyes
were clear, the heat had gone from his temples.
He was even smiling a little, though there was a
white, even frame to his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not write to Betty nor attempt to see
her,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;But I shall ask you to
take a message to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Woodward assented.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her she shall have her release, but to get
it she will have to walk through the mire and
there will be no one waiting for her on the other
side. Can you remember that? Not even you will
be there.&#8221; He was entirely self-assured so that
Woodward felt a chill of dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall contest the suit,&#8221; went on Jasper,
&#8220;and I believe that I shall win it. You may tell
Betty so if you like or she can wait to hear it
from my lawyer.&#8221; He put the envelope into his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
pocket, crossed the room, and held back one of
the crimson curtains of the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have nothing more to say,&#8221; he smiled,
&#8220;neither have I. Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bowed slightly, and Woodward found himself
passing before him in silence and some confusion.
He stood for a moment in the hall and,
having stammered his way to a cold &#8220;Good-afternoon,&#8221;
he put on his hat and went out.
</p>
<p>Jasper returned to the empty drawing-room
and began his weaving march.
</p>
<p>Before he could begin his spinning which he
hoped would entangle Betty and leave her powerless
for him to hold or to release at will, he
must go to Jane West and tell her what trick life
with his help had played upon her. The prospect
was bitterly distasteful. Jasper accused himself
of selfishness. Because she cared nothing for the
world, was a creature apart, he had let the world
think what it would. He knew that an askance
look would not hurt her; for himself, secure in
innocence, he did not care; for Betty, he had
thought her cruelly certain of him.
</p>
<p>He went to Jane the day after his interview
with Woodward Kane. It was Sunday afternoon.
She was out, but came in very soon, and he stood
up to meet her with an air of confusion and guilt.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; she asked,
pulling her gloves from her long hands.
</p>
<p>Her quickly observant eyes swept him. She
walked to him and stood near. The frosty air
was still about her and her face was lightly stung
to color with exercise. Her wild eyes were startling
under the brim of her smart, tailored hat.
</p>
<p>Jasper put a hand on either of her shoulders
and bent his head before her. &#8220;My poor child&mdash;if
I&#8217;d only left you in your kitchen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan tightened her lips, then smiled uncertainly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me scared,&#8221; she said, stepped
back and sat down, her hands in her muff.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked; and in that moment of
waiting she was sickly reminded of other moments
in her life&mdash;of the nearing sound of Pierre&#8217;s webs
on a crystal winter night, of the sound of Prosper&#8217;s
footsteps going away from her up the mountain
trail on a swordlike, autumn morning.
</p>
<p>Jasper began his pacing. Feeling carefully for
delicate phrases, he told her Betty&#8217;s accusation,
of her purpose.
</p>
<p>Joan took off her hat, pushed back the hair
from her forehead; then, as he came to the end,
she looked up at him. Her pupils were larger than
usual and the light, frosty tint of rose had left
her cheeks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me that again?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>He did so, more explicitly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks, Betty thinks, that I have been&mdash;that
we have been&mdash;? She thinks that of me? No
wonder she hasn&#8217;t been coming to see me!&#8221; She
stopped, staring blindly at him; then, &#8220;You
must tell her it isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; she said pitifully,
and the quiver of her lips hurt him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! But she doesn&#8217;t want to believe that,
my dear. She wants to believe the worst. It is her
opportunity to escape me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you loved her? Have you hurt her?&#8221;
asked Joan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows I have loved her. I have never
hurt her&mdash;consciously. Even she cannot think
that I have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why must she blame me? Why do I have to
be brought into this, Mr. Morena? Can&#8217;t she go
away from you? Why do the lawyers have to
take it up? You are unhappy, and I am so sorry.
But you wouldn&#8217;t want her to stay if&mdash;if she
doesn&#8217;t love you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want her. I mean to keep her or&mdash;break
her.&#8221; He turned his back to say this and went
toward the window. Joan, fascinated, watched
his fingers working into one another, tightening,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
crushing. &#8220;It&#8217;s another man she wants,&#8221; he said
hoarsely, &#8220;and if I can prevent it, she shall not
have him. I will force her to keep her vows to me&mdash;force
her. If it kills her, I&#8217;ll break this passion,
this fancy. I&#8217;ll have her back&mdash;&#8221; He wheeled
round, showing a twitching face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll prove her
infidelity whether she&#8217;s been unfaithful or not,
and then I&#8217;ll take her back, after the world has
given her one of its names&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t love her,&#8221; said Joan, very white.
&#8220;You want to brand her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; swore the Jew, &#8220;and I will brand
her. I&#8217;ll brand her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pocket and brought out the
small envelope Woodward Kane had handed to
him the day before. He stood turning the letter
about in his hands as though some such meaningless
occupation was a necessity to him. Joan&#8217;s
eyes, falling upon the letter, widened and fixed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has written to me,&#8221; said Jasper. &#8220;She
wants her liberty. She wants it in such a way that
she will fly clear and I&mdash;yes, and you, too, will
be left in the mud. There&#8217;s a man somewhere, of
course. She thinks she has evidence, witnesses
against me. I don&#8217;t know what rubbish she has
got together. But I&#8217;m going to fight her. I&#8217;m
going to win. I&#8217;ll save you if I can, Jane; if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
not, of course I am at your service for any
amends&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped in his halting speech, for Joan had
stood up and was moving across the room, her
eyes fastened on the letter in his hands. She had
the air of a sleep-walker.
</p>
<p>She opened a drawer of her desk, took out an
old tin box, once used for tobacco, and drew
forth a small, gray envelope torn in two. Then
she came back to him and said, &#8220;Let me see that
letter,&#8221; and he obeyed as though she had the
right to ask.
</p>
<p>She took his letter and hers and compared the
two, the small, gray squares lying unopened on
her knee, and she spoke incomprehensibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty is &#8216;the tall child,&#8217;&#8221; she said, and
laughed with a catch in her breath.
</p>
<p>Jasper looked at the envelopes. They were
identical; Betty&#8217;s gray note-paper crossed by
Betty&#8217;s angular, upright hand, very bold, very
black. The torn envelope was addressed to Prosper
Gael. Jasper took it, opened each half, laid
the parts together, and read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Jasper is dying. By the time you get this he will
be dead. If you can forgive me for having failed you
in courage last year, come back. What I have been
to you before I will be again, only, this time, we can
love openly. Come back.
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221;&mdash;Morena spoke brokenly,&mdash;&#8220;what
does it mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He built that cabin in Wyoming for her,&#8221;
said Joan, speaking as though Jasper had seen
the cañon hiding-place and known its history,
&#8220;and she didn&#8217;t come. He brought me there on
his sled. I was hurt. I was terribly hurt. He took
care of me&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prosper?&#8221; Jasper thrust in. His face was
drawn with excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Prosper Gael. I was there with him for
months. At first I wasn&#8217;t strong enough to go
away, and then, after a while, I tried. But I was
too lonely and sorrowful. In the spring I loved
him. I thought I loved him. He wanted me. I was
all alone in the world. I didn&#8217;t know that he
loved another woman. I thought she was dead&mdash;like
Pierre. Prosper had clothes for her there. I
suppose&mdash;I&#8217;ve thought it out since&mdash;that she
was to leave as if for a short journey, and then
secretly go on that long one, and she couldn&#8217;t
take many things with her. So he had beautiful
stuffs for her&mdash;and a little suit to wear in the
snow. That&#8217;s how I came to call her &#8216;the tall
child,&#8217; seeing that little suit, long and narrow....
This letter came one morning, one awfully
bright morning. He read it and went out and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
next day he went away. Afterwards I found the
letter torn in two beside his desk on the floor. I
took it and I&#8217;ve always kept it. &#8216;The tall child&#8217;!
He looked so terrible when I called her that....
And she was your Betty all the time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Morena slowly. &#8220;She was my
Betty all the time.&#8221; He gave her a twisted smile
and put the two papers carefully into an inside
pocket. &#8220;I am going to keep this letter, Jane.
Truly the ways of the Lord are past finding out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan looked at him in growing uneasiness. Her
mind, never quick to take in all the bearings and
the consequences of her acts, was beginning to
work. &#8220;What are you going to do with it, Mr.
Morena? I don&#8217;t want you to do Betty a hurt.
She must have loved Prosper Gael. Perhaps she
still loves him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This odd appeal drew another difficult smile
from Betty&#8217;s husband. &#8220;Quite obviously she still
loves him, Jane. She is divorcing me so that she
can marry him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Morena, I don&#8217;t believe he will
marry her now. He is tired of her. He is that kind
of lover. He gets tired. Now he would like to
marry me. He told me so. Perhaps&mdash;if Betty
knew that&mdash;she might come back to you, without
your branding her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>Jasper was startled out of his vengeful stillness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prosper Gael wants to marry you? He has
told you so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She was sad and humbled. &#8220;<i>Now</i> he
wants to marry me and once he told me things
about marrying. He said&#8221;&mdash;Joan quoted slowly,
her eyes half-closed in Prosper&#8217;s manner, her
voice a musical echo of his thin, vibrant tone&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s
man&#8217;s most studied insult to woman.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s Prosper,&#8221; murmured Jasper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t marry him, Mr. Morena, even if
I could&mdash;not if I were to be&mdash;burnt for refusing
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper looked probingly at her, a new speculation
in his eyes. She had begun to fit definitely
into his plans. It seemed there might be a way to
frustrate Betty and to keep a hold upon his valuable
protégée. &#8220;Are you so sure of that, Jane?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she answered; &#8220;you doubt it because I
once thought I loved him? But you don&#8217;t know
all about me....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood silent, busy with his weaving. At last
he looked at her rather blankly, impersonally.
Joan was conscious of a frightened, lonely chill.
She put out her hand uncertainly, a wrinkle appearing
sharp and deep between her eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Morena, please&mdash;I haven&#8217;t any one but
you. I don&#8217;t understand very well what this
divorcing rightly means. Nor what they will do
to me. Will you be thinking of me a little? I
wouldn&#8217;t ask it, for I know you are unhappy
and bothered enough, but, you see&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not notice the hand. &#8220;It will come out
right, Jane. Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said with absent
gentleness. &#8220;Keep your mind on your work. I&#8217;ll
look out for your best interests. Be sure of that.&#8221;
He came near to her, his hat in his hand, ready
to go. &#8220;Try to forget all about it, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t do that. I feel sort of&mdash;burnt.
Betty thinking&mdash;that! But I&#8217;ll do my work just
the same, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sighed heavily and sat, the unnoticed
hand clasped in its fellow.
</p>
<p>When he had gone she called nervously for
her maid. She had a hitherto unknown dread of
being alone. But when Mathilde, chosen by
Betty, came with her furtive step and treacherous
eyes, Joan invented some duty for her. It occurred
to her that Mathilde might be one of
Betty&#8217;s witnesses. For some time the girl&#8217;s watchfulness
and intrusions had become irritatingly
noticeable. And Morena was Joan&#8217;s only frequent
and informal visitor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mathilde thinks I am&mdash;<i>that</i>!&#8221; Joan said to
herself; and afterwards, with a burst of weeping,
&#8220;And, of course, that is what I am.&#8221; Her past
sin pressed upon her and she trembled, remembering
Pierre&#8217;s wistful, seeking face. If he should
find her now, he would find her branded, indeed&mdash;now
he could never believe that she had indeed
been innocent of guilt in the matter of
Holliwell. Her father had first put a mark upon
her. Since then the world had only deepened his
revenge.
</p>
<p>There followed a sleepless, dry, and aching
night.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE SPIDER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hullo. Is this Mrs. Morena?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty held the receiver languidly. Her
face had grown very thin and her eyes were
patient. They were staring now absently through
the front window of Woodward Kane&#8217;s sitting-room
at a day of driving April rain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. This is Mrs. Morena.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next speech changed her into a flushed
and palpitating girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gael wishes to know, madam,&#8221;&mdash;the
man-servant recited his lesson automatically,&mdash;&#8220;if
you have seen the exhibition of Foster&#8217;s
water-colors, Fifty-eighth Street and Fifth Avenue.
He wants to know if you will be there this
afternoon at five o&#8217;clock. No. 88 in the inner
room is the picture he would especially like you
to notice, madam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty&#8217;s hand and voice were trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I haven&#8217;t seen it.&#8221; She hesitated, looking
at the downpour. &#8220;Tell him, please, that I
will be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>The man at the other end clipped out a &#8220;Very
well, madam,&#8221; and hung up.
</p>
<p>Betty was puzzled. Why had Prosper sent her
this message, made this appointment by his servant?
Perhaps because he was afraid that, in her
exaggerated caution, she might refuse to meet
him if she could explain to him the reason for her
refusal, or gauge the importance of his request.
With a servant she could do neither, and the very
uncertainty would force her to accept. It was a
dreadful day. Nobody would be out, certainly
not at the tea-hour, to look at Foster&#8217;s pictures&mdash;an
insignificant exhibition. Betty felt triumphant.
At last, this far too acquiescent lover had
rebelled against her decree of silence and separation.
</p>
<p>At five o&#8217;clock she stepped out of her taxicab,
made a run for shelter, and found herself in the
empty exhibition rooms. She checked her wrap
and her umbrella, took a catalogue from the
little table, chatted for a moment with the man
in charge, then moved about, looking carelessly
at the pictures. No. 88 in the inner room! Her
heart was beating violently, the hand in her muff
was cold. She went slowly toward the inner room
and saw at once that, under a small canvas at its
far end, Prosper stood waiting for her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>He waited even after he had seen her smile and
quickening step, and when he did come forward,
it was with obvious reluctance. Betty&#8217;s smile
faded. His face was haggard and grim, unlike
itself; his eyes lack-luster as she had never seen
them. This was not the face of an impatient
lover. It was&mdash;she would not name it, but she
was conscious of a feeling of angry sickness.
</p>
<p>He took her hand and forced a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty, I thought you disapproved of this
kind of thing. I think, myself, it&#8217;s rather imprudent
to arrange a meeting through your maid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty jerked away her hand, drew a sharp
breath. &#8220;What do you mean? I didn&#8217;t arrange
this meeting. It was you&mdash;your man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They became simultaneously aware of a trap.
It had sprung upon them. With the look of
trapped things, they stared at each other, and
Betty instinctively looked back over her shoulder.
There stood Jasper in the doorway of the room.
He looked like the most casual of visitors to an
art-gallery, he carried a catalogue in his hand.
When he saw that he was seen he smiled easily
and came over to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have to forgive me,&#8221; he murmured
pleasantly; &#8220;you see, it was necessary to see you
both together and Betty is not willing to allow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
me an interview. I am sorry to have chosen a
public place and to have used a trick to get you
here, but I could not think of any other plan.
This is really private enough. I have arranged
this exhibition for Foster and it is closed to the
public to-day. We got in by special permit&mdash;a
fact you probably missed. And, after all, civilized
people ought to be able to talk about anything
without excitement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty&#8217;s eyes glared at him. &#8220;I will not stay!
This is insufferable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he put out his hand and something in his
gesture compelled her. She sat down on the
round, plush seat in the middle of the room and
looked up at the two men helplessly. Joan had
once leaned in a doorway, silent and unconsulted,
while two men, her father and Pierre, settled
their property rights in her. Betty was, after all,
in no better case. She listened, whiter and whiter,
till at the last she slowly raised her muff and
pressed it against her twisted mouth.
</p>
<p>Morena stood with his hand resting on the
high back of the circular seat almost directly
above Betty&#8217;s head. It seemed to hold her there
like a bar. But it was at Prosper he looked, to
Prosper he spoke. &#8220;My friend,&#8221; he began, and
the accentuation of the Hebraic quality of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
voice had an instantaneous effect upon his two
listeners. Both Prosper and Betty knew he was
master of some intense agitation. They were
conscious of an increasing rapidity of their pulses.
&#8220;My friend, I thought that I knew you fairly
well, as one man knows another, but I find that
there have been certain limits to my knowledge.
How extraordinary it is! This inner world of our
own lives which we keep closely to ourselves! I
have a friend, yes, a very good friend, a very
dear friend,&#8221;&mdash;the ironic insistence upon this
word gave Prosper the shock of a repeated blow,&mdash;&#8220;and
I fancy, in the ignorance of my conceit,
that this friend&#8217;s life is sufficiently open to my
understanding. I see him leave college, I see him
go out on various adventures. I share with him,
by letters and confidences, the excitement of
these adventures. I know with regret that he
suffers from ill-health and goes West, and there,
with a great deal of sympathy, I imagine him
living, drearily enough, in some small, health-giving
Western town, writing his book and later
his play which he has so generously allowed me
to produce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil are you after, Jasper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do my friend an injustice,&#8221; went on
the manager, undiverted. &#8220;His career is infinitely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
more romantic. He has built himself a little log
house amongst the mountains, and he has decorated
it and laid in a supply of dainty and exquisite
stuffs. I believe that there is even an outing
suit, small and narrow&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said Prosper, very low.
</p>
<p>There was a silence. Jasper moved slightly, and
Prosper started, but the Jew stayed in his former
place, only that he bent his head a little, half-closed
his eyes, and marked time with the hand
that was not buried in the plush above Betty&#8217;s
head. He recited in a heavy voice, and it was
here that Betty raised her muff!
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Jasper is dying. By the time you get this letter he
will be dead. If you can forgive me for having failed
in courage last year, come back. What I have been to
you before, I will be to you again, only this time we
can love openly. Come back.
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I am going mad!&#8221; said Prosper harshly,
and indeed his face had a pinched, half-crazy
look.
</p>
<p>The Jew waved his hand. &#8220;Oh, no, no, no. It is
only that you are making a discovery. Letters
should be burnt, my friend, not torn and thrown
away, but burnt.&#8221; He stood up to his stateliest
height and he made a curious and rather terrible
gesture of breaking something between his two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
hands. &#8220;I have this letter and I hold you and
Betty&mdash;so!&#8221; he said softly&mdash;&#8220;so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty spoke. &#8220;I might have told you that I
loved him, that I have loved him for years,
Jasper. If you use this evidence, if you bring this
counter-suit, it will bring about the same, the
very same, result. Prosper and I&mdash;&#8221; She broke
off choking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Betty and I will be married at
once, as soon as she gets her divorce, or you get
yours.&#8221; But Prosper&#8217;s voice was hollow and
strained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be married, Betty,&#8221; went on Jasper
as calmly as before; &#8220;you, branded in the eyes of
the world as an unfaithful wife, will be married
to a man who has ceased to love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not true,&#8221; said Betty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at his face, my dear. Look at it carefully.
Now, watch it closely. Prosper Gael, if I
should tell that with a little patience, a little skill,
a little unselfishness, you could win a certain
woman who once loved you&mdash;eh?&mdash;a certain
Jane West, could you bring yourself to marry
this discarded wife of mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty sprang up and caught Prosper&#8217;s arm in
her small hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is tired of you, Betty. He loves Jane
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
West.&#8221; Jasper laughed shortly, looking at the
tableau they made: Prosper white, caught in
the teeth of honor, his face set to hide its secret,
Betty reading his eyes, his soul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am entirely yours, in your hands,&#8221; said
Prosper Gael.
</p>
<p>Betty shook his arm and let it go. &#8220;You are
lying. You love the woman. Do you think I can&#8217;t
see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a very strange divorce suit,&#8221; went
on Jasper. &#8220;Your lawyers, Betty, will perhaps
prove your case. My lawyers will certainly prove
mine, and, when we find ourselves free, our&mdash;our
lovers will then unite in holy matrimony&mdash;rather
an original outcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you go, Prosper?&#8221; asked Betty. It was
a command.
</p>
<p>He saw that, at that moment, his presence was
intolerable to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. If you wish it. Jasper, you know
where to find me, and, Betty,&#8221;&mdash;he turned to
her with a weary tenderness,&mdash;&#8220;forgive me and
make use of me, if you will, as you will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out quickly, feeling himself a coward
to leave her, knowing that he would be a coward
to stay to watch the anguish of her broken heart
and pride. For an instant he did hesitate and look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
back. They were standing together, calmly, man
and wife. What could he do to help them, he that
had broken their lives?
</p>
<p>Betty turned to Jasper, still with the muff before
her mouth, looking at him above it with her
wide, childlike, desperate eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you get out of this, Jasper? I will
go to Woodward. I will never come back to you....
Is it revenge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If so,&#8221; said Jasper, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t yet complete.
Betty, you have been rash to pit yourself against
me. You must have known that I would break
you utterly. I will break you, my dear, and I will
have you back, and I will be your master instead
of your servant, and I will love you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be mad. I&#8217;m afraid of you. Please
let me go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a moment, when you have learned what
home you have to go to. This morning I had an
interview with your brother in his office, and he
wrote this letter that I have in my pocket and
asked me to give it to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty laid down her muff, showing at last the
pale and twisted mouth. Jasper watched her read
her brother&#8217;s letter, and his eyes were as patient
and observant as the eyes of a skillful doctor who
has given a dangerous but necessary draught.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>Betty read the small, sharp, careful writing,
very familiar to her.
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>I have instructed your maid to pack your things
and to return at once to your husband&#8217;s house. He is
a much too merciful man. You have treated him
shamelessly. I can find no excuse for you. My house
is definitely closed to you. I will send you no money,
allow you no support, countenance you in no way.
This is final. You have only one course, to return
humbly and with penitence to your husband, submit
yourself to him, and learn to love and honor and
obey him as he deserves. The evidence of your guilt
is incontrovertible. I utterly disbelieve your story
against him. It is part of your sin, and it is easily to
be explained in the light of my present knowledge of
your real character. Whether you return to Morena
or not, I emphatically reassert that I will not see you
or speak to you again. You are to my mind a woman
of shameless life, such a woman as I should feel
justified in turning out of any decent household.
</p>

<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Woodward Kane</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>The room turned giddily about Betty. She saw
the whole roaring city turn about her, and she
knew that there was no home in it for her. She
could go to Prosper Gael, but at what horrible
sacrifice of pride, and, if Jasper now refused to
bring suit, could she ask this man, who no longer
loved her, to keep her as his mistress? What could
she do? Where could she turn? How could she
keep herself alive? For the first time, life, stripped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
of everything but its hard and ugly bones, faced
her. She had always been sheltered, been dependent,
been loved. Once before she had lost courage
and had failed to venture beyond the familiar
shelter of custom and convention. Now, she was
again most horribly afraid. Anything was better
than this feeling of being lost, alone. She looked
at Jasper. At that moment he was nothing but a
protector, a means of life, and he knew it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come home with me now?&#8221; he asked
her bitterly.
</p>
<p>Betty forced the twisted mouth to speech.
&#8220;What else is there for me to do?&#8221; she said.

<h3>THE CLEAN WILD THING</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The Reverend Francis Holliwell.&#8221; Morena
turned the card over and over in his hand.
&#8220;Holliwell. Holliwell. Frank Holliwell.&#8221; Yes.
One of the fellows that had dropped out. Big,
athletic youngster; left college in his junior year
and studied for the ministry. Fine chap. Popular.
Especially decent to him when he had begun to
play that difficult role of a man without a country.
Now here was the card of the Reverend
Francis Holliwell and the man himself, no doubt,
waiting below. Jasper tried to remember. He&#8217;d
heard something about Frank. Oh, yes. The
young clergyman had given up a fashionable
parish in the East&mdash;small Norman church,
wealthy parishioners, splendid stipend, beautiful
stone Norman rectory&mdash;thrown it all up to go
West on some unheard-of mission in the sagebrush.
He was back now, probably for money,
donations wanted for a building, church or hospital
or library. Jasper in imagination wrote out
a generous check. Before going down he glanced
at the card again and noticed some lines across
the back:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>This is to introduce one of my best friends, Pierre
Landis, of Wyoming. Please be of service to him.
His mission has and deserves to have my full sympathy.
</p>
</div>
<p>So, after all, it wasn&#8217;t Holliwell below and the
check-book would not be needed. &#8220;Pierre Landis,
of Wyoming.&#8221; Jasper went down the stairs and
on the way he remembered a letter received from
Yarnall a long time before. He remembered it
with an accession of alarm. &#8220;I&#8217;ve probably let
hell loose for your protégée, Jane; given your
address, and incidentally hers, to a fellow who
wants her pretty badly. His name&#8217;s Pierre Landis.
You&#8217;re a pretty good judge of white men.
Size him up and do what&#8217;s best for Jane.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some time after receiving this letter,
Jasper had expected the appearance of this Pierre
Landis, then had forgotten him. The fellow who
wanted Jane so badly had been a long while on
his way to her. Remembering and wondering,
the manager opened the crimson curtains and
stepped into the presence of Pierre.
</p>
<p>Even if he had had no foreknowledge, Jasper
felt that, at sight of his visitor, his fancy would
have jumped to Joan. It was the eyes; he had
seen no others but hers like them for clarity; far-seeing,
grave eyes that held a curious depth of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
light. Here was one of Joan&#8217;s kindred, one of the
clean, wild things.
</p>
<p>Then came the gentle Western drawl. &#8220;I&#8217;m
right sorry to trouble you, Mr. Morena.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper took a brown hand that had the feel of
iron. The man&#8217;s face, on a level with Jasper&#8217;s,
was very brown and lean. It had a worn look, a
trifle desperate, perhaps, in the lines of lip and
the expression of the smoke-colored eyes. Jasper,
sensitive to undercurrents, became aware that he
stood in some fashion for a forlorn hope in the
life of this Pierre. At the same time the manager
remembered a confidence of Jane&#8217;s. She had been
&#8220;afraid of some one.&#8221; She had been running
away. There was one that mustn&#8217;t find her,
and to run away from him, that was the business
of her life. Pierre Landis was this &#8220;one,&#8221;
the something wild and clean that had at last
come searching even into this city. It was necessary
that Jane&#8217;s present protector should be very
careful. There must be no running away this time,
and Pierre must be warned off. Jasper had plans
of his own for his star player. For one thing she
must draw Prosper Gael completely out of Betty&#8217;s
life.
</p>
<p>Jasper made his guest comfortable, sat opposite
to him, and lighted a cigarette. Although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Pierre had accepted one, he did not smoke. He
was far too disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank Holliwell gave me a note to you, Mr.
Morena. I got your address some years ago from
Yarnall, of Lazy-Y Ranch, Middle Fork, Wyoming.
I&#8217;ve been gettin&#8217; my affairs into shape
ever since, so that I could come East. I don&#8217;t
rightly know whether Yarnall would have wrote
to you concernin&#8217; me or no.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He did write&mdash;just a line&mdash;two years
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre studied his own long, brown hands,
turning the soft hat between them. When he
lifted his eyes, they were intensely blue. It was
as though blue fire had consumed the smoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been takin&#8217; after a girl. She was called
Jane on Yarnall&#8217;s ranch an&#8217; she was cook there
for the outfit. Nobody knowed her story nor her
name. She left the mornin&#8217; I came in an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t
set eyes on her. You were takin&#8217; her East to teach
her to play-act for you. I don&#8217;t know whether
you done so or not, but I&#8217;ve come here to learn
where she is so that I can find out if she&#8217;s the
woman I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morena smiled kindly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve come a long
way, Mr. Landis, on an uncertainty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Pierre did not smile. He was holding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
himself steady. &#8220;But I&#8217;m used to uncertainty.
There ain&#8217;t no uncertainty that can keep me
from seekin&#8217; after the person I want.&#8221; He paused,
the eyes still fixed upon Morena, who, uncomfortable
under them, veiled himself thinly in
cigarette smoke. &#8220;I want to see this Jane,&#8221;
Pierre ended gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing easier, Landis. I&#8217;ll give you a ticket
to &#8216;The Leopardess.&#8217; She is acting the title part.
She is my leading lady and a very extraordinary
young actress. Of course, it&#8217;s none of my business,
but in a way I am Miss West&#8217;s guardian&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss West?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. That is Jane&#8217;s name&mdash;Jane West. You
think it is an assumed one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre stood up. &#8220;I&#8217;m not thinkin&#8217; on this
trip,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m hopin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, but I am afraid you&#8217;re on the
wrong track. There may be a resemblance, there
may even be a marked resemblance, between
Miss West and the person you want to find, but&mdash;again
please forgive me&mdash;I am in the place
of guardian to her at present and I should like to
know something of your business, enough of it,
that is, to be sure that your sudden appearance,
if you happen to be right in your surmise,
won&#8217;t frighten my leading lady out of her wits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
and send her off to Kalamazoo on the next
train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre evidently resented the fashion of this
speech. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said with dignity, &#8220;not
to be able to tell you anything. I&#8217;ll be careful
not to frighten Miss West. I can see her first
from a distance an&#8217; then&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Certainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper rang and directed his man to get an
envelope from an upstairs table. When it came,
he handed it to Pierre.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a ticket for to-morrow night&#8217;s performance.
It&#8217;s the best seat I can give you,
though it is not very near the stage. However,
you will certainly be able to recognize your&mdash;Jane,
if she is your Jane.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre pocketed the ticket. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he
murmured. His face was expressionless.
</p>
<p>Jasper was making rapid plans. &#8220;Oh, by the
way,&#8221; he said hurriedly, &#8220;if you should stand
near the stage exit to-night, say at about twelve
o&#8217;clock, you could see Miss West come out and
get into her motor. That would give you a fairly
close view. But even if you find you are mistaken,
Landis, be sure to see &#8216;The Leopardess.&#8217; It&#8217;s well
worth your while. You&#8217;re going? Won&#8217;t you dine
with me to-night?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I wouldn&#8217;t be carin&#8217; to to-night.
I&mdash;I reckon I&#8217;ve got this matter too much
on my mind. Thank you very much, Mr. Morena.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you go, tell me about Holliwell. He
was a good friend of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a good friend to most every one he
knowed. He was more than that to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s been a success out there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre meditated over the words. &#8220;Success?
Why, yes, I reckon he&#8217;s been all of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A difficult mission, isn&#8217;t it? Trying to bring
you fellows to God?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre smiled. &#8220;I reckon we get closer to God
out there than you do here. We sure get the fear
of Him even if we don&#8217;t get nothin&#8217; else. When
you fight winter an&#8217; all outdoors an&#8217; come near
to death with hosses an&#8217; what-not, why, I guess
you&#8217;re gettin&#8217; close to <i>somethin&#8217;</i> not quite to be
explained. Holliwell, he&#8217;s a first-class sin-buster,
best I ever knowed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morena laughed. He was beginning to enjoy
his visitor. &#8220;Sin-buster?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one name fer a parson. Well, sir, I
guess Holliwell is plumb close to bein&#8217; a prize
devil-twister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me how you first met him. It ought to be
a good story.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>But the young man&#8217;s face grew bleak at this.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t a good story, sir,&#8221; he said grimly. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t anything like that. I must wish you good-by,
an&#8217; thank you kindly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll let me see you again? Where are
you stopping? Holliwell&#8217;s friends are mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre gave him the address of a small, downtown
hotel, thanked him again, and, standing in
the hall, added, &#8220;If I&#8217;m wrong in the notion that
brought me to New York, I&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; back
again to my ranch, Mr. Morena. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back
to ranchin&#8217; on the old homestead. I&#8217;ve got it
fixed up.&#8221; He seemed to look through Jasper into
an enormous distance. Morena was almost uncannily
aware of the long, long journey by which
this man&#8217;s spirit had trodden, of the desert he
faced ahead of him if the search must fail. Was it
wrong to warn Jane? Ought this man to be given
his chance? Surely here stood before him Jane&#8217;s
mate. Jasper wished that he knew more of the
history back of Pierre and the girl. A man could
do little but look out for his own interests, when
he worked in the dark. Which would be the
better man for Jane?&mdash;this Jane so trained, so
educated, so far removed superficially from the
ungrammatical, bronzed, clumsily dressed, graceful
visitor. In every worldly respect, doubtless,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
Prosper Gael. Only&mdash;there were Pierre&#8217;s eyes
and the soul looking out of them.
</p>
<p>Jasper said good-bye half-absently.
</p>
<p>An hour later he went to call on Jane.
</p>
<p>He found her done up in an apron and a dust-cap
cleaning house with astonishing spirit. She
and the Bridget, who had recently been substituted
for Mathilde, were merry. Bridget was sitting
on the sill, her upper half shut out, her
round, brick-colored face laughing through the
pane she was polishing. Jane was up a ladder,
dusting books.
</p>
<p>She came down to greet Morena, and he saw
regretfully the sad change in her face and bearing
which his arrival caused. Bridget was sent to the
kitchen. Jane made apologies, and sitting on the
ladder step she looked up at him with the look of
some one who expects a blow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it now, Mr. Morena? Have the lawyers
begun to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had purposely kept her in the dark, purposely
neglected her, left her to loneliness, in
the hope of furthering the purposes of Prosper
Gael.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t come to discuss that, Jane. Soon I
hope to have good news for you. But to-day I&#8217;ve
come to give you a hint&mdash;a warning, in fact&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
prepare you for what I am sure will be a
shock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; She was flushed and breathing fast.
Her fingers were busy with the feather-duster on
her knee and her eyes were still waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a visitor this morning&mdash;Pierre Landis,
of Wyoming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose, came to him, and clutched his arm.
&#8220;Pierre? Pierre?&#8221; She looked around her, wild
as a captured bird. &#8220;Oh, I must go! I must go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, my child,&#8221;&mdash;he put his arm about her,
held her two hands in his,&mdash;&#8220;you must do
nothing of the kind. If you don&#8217;t want this Pierre
to find you, if you don&#8217;t want him to come into
your life, there&#8217;s an easy, a very simple, way to
put an end to his pursuit. Don&#8217;t you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stared up at him, quivering in his arm.
&#8220;No. What is it? How can I? Oh, he mustn&#8217;t see
me! Never, never, never! I made that promise to
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, you say yourself that you are changed,
that you are not the girl he wants to find.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shook her head desolately enough. &#8220;Oh,
no, I&#8217;m not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t sure that Jane West is the woman
he&#8217;s looking for. He&#8217;s following the faintest, the
most doubtful, of trails. He heard of you from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Yarnall; the description of you and your sudden
flight made him fairly sure that it must be&mdash;you&mdash;&#8221;
Jasper laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m talking quite at
random in a sense, because I haven&#8217;t a notion,
my dear, who you are nor what this Pierre has
been in your life. If you could tell me&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said; &#8220;no.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Then I&#8217;ll have to go on talking at
random. Jane at the Lazy-Y Ranch was a
woman who had deliberately disguised herself.
Jane West in New York is a different woman altogether;
but, unless I&#8217;m very wrong, she is even
more completely disguised from Pierre Landis.
If you can convince Pierre that you <i>are</i> Jane
West, not any other woman, certainly not the
woman he once knew, aren&#8217;t you pretty safely
rid of him for always?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood still now. He felt that her fingers
were cold. &#8220;Yes. For always. I suppose so. But
how can I do that, Mr. Morena?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing easier. You&#8217;re an actress, aren&#8217;t
you? I advised Pierre Landis to stand near the
stage exit to-night and watch you get into your
motor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she clutched at him. &#8220;Oh, no. Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t
let him do that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you will make an effort, look him in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the eyes, refuse to show a single quiver of recognition,
speak to some one in the most artificial
tone you can manage, pass him by, and drive
away, why, wouldn&#8217;t that convince him that
you aren&#8217;t his quarry&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She thought! then slowly drew herself away
and stood, her head bent, her brows drawn
sharply together. &#8220;Yes. I suppose so. I think
I can do it. That is the best plan.&#8221; She looked
at him wildly again. &#8220;Then it will be over for
always, won&#8217;t it? He&#8217;ll go away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my poor child. He will go away. He told
me so. Then, will you try to forget him, to live
your life for its own beautiful sake? I&#8217;d like to
see you happy, Jane.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; She smiled like a pitying
mother. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve given up even dreaming of
that. That isn&#8217;t what keeps me going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, then, Jane?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a queer notion.&#8221; She laughed sadly. &#8220;A
kind of kid&#8217;s notion, I guess, that if you live
along, some way, some time, you&#8217;ll be able to
make up for things you&#8217;ve done, and that perhaps
there&#8217;ll be another meeting-place&mdash;a kind
of a round-up&mdash;where you&#8217;ll be fit to forgive
those you love and to be forgiven by them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jasper walked about. He was touched and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
troubled. Some minutes later he said doubtfully,
&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll carry through your purpose of not
letting Pierre know you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve made up my mind to that. That&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ve got to do. He mustn&#8217;t find me. We
can&#8217;t meet here in this life. That&#8217;s certain. There
are things that come between, things like bars.&#8221;
She made a strange gesture as of a prisoner running
his fingers across the barred window of a
cell. &#8220;Thank you for warning me. Thank you for
telling me what to do.&#8221; She smiled faintly. &#8220;I
think he will know me, anyway,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
I won&#8217;t know him. Never! Never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That night the theater was late in emptying
itself. Jane West had acted with especial brilliance
and she was called out again and again. When
she came to her dressing-room she was flushed
and breathless. She did not change her costume,
but drew her fur coat on over the green evening
dress she had worn in the last scene. Then she
stood before her mirror, looking herself over carefully,
critically. Now that the paint was washed
off, and the flush of excitement faded, she looked
haggard and white. Her face was very thin, its
beautiful bones&mdash;long sweep of jaw, wide brow,
straight, short nose&mdash;sharply accentuated. The
round throat rising against the fur collar looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
unnaturally white and long. She sat down before
her dressing-table and deliberately painted her
cheeks and lips. She even altered the outlines of
her mouth, giving it a pursed and doll-like expression,
so that her eyes appeared enormous
and her nose a little pinched. Then she drew a
lock of waved hair down across the middle of her
forehead, pressed another at each side close to
the corners of her eyes. This took from the unusual
breadth of brow and gave her a much more
ordinary look. A coat of powder, heavily applied,
more nearly produced the effect of a pink-and-white,
glassy-eyed doll-baby for which she was
trying. Afterwards she turned and smiled doubtfully
at the astonished dresser.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Miss West! You don&#8217;t look
like yourself at all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said good-night and went rapidly down
the draughty passages and the concrete stairs.
Jasper was standing inside the outer door and
applauded her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done. If it weren&#8217;t for your pose and
walk, my dear, I should hardly have known you
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan stood beside him, holding her furs close,
breathing fast through the parted, painted lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is he here, do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s been waiting. I told him you might
be late. Now, keep your head. Everything depends
upon that. Can you do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Is the car there? I won&#8217;t have to
stop?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an instant. But give him a good looking-over
so that he&#8217;ll be sure, and don&#8217;t change the
expression of your eyes. Feel, make yourself feel
<i>inside</i>, that he&#8217;s a stranger. You know what I
mean. Good-night, my dear. Good luck. I&#8217;ll call
you up as soon as you get home&mdash;that is, after
I&#8217;ve seen your pursuer safely back to his rooms.&#8221;
But this last sentence was addressed to himself.
</p>
<p>Joan opened the door and stepped out into the
chill dampness of the April night. The white
arc of electric light beat down upon her as she
came forward and it fell as glaringly upon the
figure of Pierre. He had pushed forward from the
little crowd of nondescripts always waiting at
a stage exit, and stood, bareheaded, just at the
door of her motor drawn up by the curb. She saw
him instantly and from the first their eyes met.
It was a horrible moment for Joan. What it was
for him, she could tell by the tense pallor of his
keen, bronzed face. The eyes she had not seen
for such an agony of years, the strange, deep,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
iris-colored eyes, there they were now searching
her. She stopped her heart in its beating, she
stopped her breath, stopped her brain. She became
for those few seconds just one thought&mdash;&#8220;I
have never seen you. I have never seen you.&#8221;
She passed so close to him that her fur touched
his hand, and she looked into his face with a cool,
half-disdainful glitter of a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Step aside, please,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I must get in.&#8221;
Her voice was unnaturally high and quite unnaturally
precise.
</p>
<p>Pierre said one word, a hopeless word. &#8220;Joan.&#8221;
It was a prayer. It should have been, &#8220;Be Joan.&#8221;
Then he stepped back and she stumbled into
shelter.
</p>
<p>At the same instant another man&mdash;a man in
evening dress&mdash;hastily prevented her man from
closing the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss West, may I see you home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before she could speak, could do more than
look, Prosper Gael had jumped in, the door
slammed, the car began its whirr, and they were
gliding through the crowded, brilliant streets.
</p>
<p>Joan had bent forward and was rocking to and
fro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He called me &#8216;Joan,&#8217;&#8221; she gasped over and
over. &#8220;He called me &#8216;Joan.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was Pierre?&#8221; Prosper had been forewarned
by Jasper and had planned his part.
</p>
<p>She kept on rocking, holding her hands on
either side of her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go away. If I see him again I shall die.
I could never do that another time. O God! His
hand touched me. He called me &#8216;Joan&#8217; ... I
must go....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper did not touch her, but his voice, very
friendly, very calm, had an instantaneous effect.
&#8220;I will take you away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed shakily. &#8220;Again?&#8221; she asked, and
shamed him into silence.
</p>
<p>But after a while he began very reasonably,
very patiently:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take you away so that you need not be
put through this unnecessary pain. I can arrange
it with Morena. If Pierre sees you often enough,
he will be sure to recognize you. Joan, I did not
deserve that &#8216;again&#8217; and you know it. I am a
changed man. If you don&#8217;t know that now I have
the heart of&mdash;of devotion, of service, toward
you, you are indeed a blind and stupid woman.
But you do know it. You must.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat silent beside him, the long and slender
hand between her face and him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take you away,&#8221; he went on presently,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
&#8220;and keep you from Pierre until he has given up
his search and has gone West again. And I can
take you at once&mdash;in a day or two. Your understudy
can fill the part. This engagement is almost
at an end. I can make it up to Morena. After all,
if we go, we shall be doing Betty and him a
service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan flung out her hands recklessly. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she
cried, &#8220;what does it matter? Of course I&#8217;ll go.
I&#8217;d run into the sea to escape Pierre&mdash;&#8221; She
leaned back against the cushioned seat, rolled
her head a little from side to side like a person in
pain. &#8220;Take me away,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I believe
that if I stay I shall go mad. I&#8217;ll go anywhere&mdash;with
any one. Only take me away.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE LEOPARDESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Pierre stood before the cheap bureau of
his ugly hotel bedroom turning a red slip
of cardboard about in his fingers. The gas-jet
sputtering above his head threw heavy shadows
down on his face. It was the face of hopeless,
heartsick youth, the muscles sagging, the eyes
dull, the lips tight and pale. Since last night when
the contemptuous glitter of Joan&#8217;s smile had
fallen upon him, he had neither slept nor eaten.
Jasper had joined him at the theater exit, had
walked home with him, and, while he was with
the manager, Pierre&#8217;s pride and reserve had held
him up. Afterwards he had ranged the city like a
prairie wolf, ranged it as though it had been an
unpeopled desert, free to his stride. He had fixed
his eyes above and beyond and walked alone in
pain.
</p>
<p>Dawn found him again in his room. What hope
had sustained him, what memory of Joan, what
purpose of tenderness toward her&mdash;these hopes
and memories and purposes now choked and
twisted him. He might have found her, his &#8220;gel,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
his Joan, with her dumb, loving gaze; he might
have told her the story of his sorrow in such a
way that she, who forgave so easily, would have
forgiven even him, and he might have comforted
her, holding her so and so, showing her
utterly the true, unchanged, greatly changed
love of his chastened heart. This girl, this love of
his, whom, in his drunken, jealous madness, he
had branded and driven away, he would have
brought her back and tended her and made it up
to her in a thousand, in ten thousand, ways.
Pierre knelt by his bed, his black head buried in
the cover, his arms bent above it, his hands
clenched. Out there he had never lost hope of
finding her, but here, in this peopled loneliness,
with a memory of that woman&#8217;s heartless smile,
he did at last despair. In a strange, torturing way
she had been like Joan. His heart had jumped to
his mouth at first sight of her. And just there,
to his shoulder where her head reached, had
Joan&#8217;s dear black head reached too. Pierre
groaned aloud. The picture of her was so vivid.
Not in months had the reality of his &#8220;gel&#8221; come
so close to his imagination. He could feel her&mdash;feel
her! O God!
</p>
<p>That was the sort of night he had spent and
the next day he passed in a lethargy. He had no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
heart to face the future now that the great purpose
of his life had failed. Holliwell&#8217;s God of
comfort and forgiveness forsook him. What did
he want with a God when that one comrade of
his lonely, young, human life was out there lost
by his own cruelty! Perhaps she was dead. Perhaps
the wound had killed her. For all these
years she might have been lying dead somewhere
in the snow, under the sky. Sharp periods of
pain followed dull periods of stupor. Now it was
night again and a recollection of Jasper&#8217;s theater
ticket had dragged him to a vague purpose. He
wanted to see again that woman who had so
vivified his memory of Joan. It would be hateful
to see her again, but he wanted the pain. He
dressed and groomed himself carefully. Then,
feeling a little faint, he went out into the clattering,
glaring night.
</p>
<p>Pierre&#8217;s experience of theater-going was exceedingly
small. He had never been in so large a
play-house as this one of Morena&#8217;s; he had never
seen so large and well-dressed an audience; never
heard a full and well-trained orchestra. In spite
of himself, he began to be distracted, excited,
stirred. When the curtain rose on the beautiful
tropical scene, the lush island, the turquoise sea,
the realistic strip of golden sand, Pierre gave an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
audible oath of admiration and surprise. The
people about him began to be amused by the
excitement of this handsome, haggard young
man, so graceful and intense, so different with
his hardness and leanness, the brilliance of his
eyes, the brownness of his skin. His clothes were
good enough, but they fitted him with an odd air
of disguise. An experienced eye would inevitably
have seen the appropriateness of flannel shirt,
gay silk neck-handkerchief, boots, spurs, and
<i>chaparreras</i>. Pierre was entirely unaware of being
interesting or different. At that moment, caught
up in the action of the play, he was as outside of
himself as a child.
</p>
<p>The palms of stage-land stirred, the ferns
swayed; between then: tall, vivid greenness came
Joan with her tread and grace and watchful eyes
of a leopardess, her loose, wild hair decked with
flowers: these and her make-up and her thinness
disguised her completely from Pierre, but again
his heart came to his throat and, when she put
her hands up to her mouth and called, his pulses
gave a leap. He shut his eyes. He remembered a
voice calling him in to supper. &#8220;Pi-erre! Pi-erre!&#8221;
He could sniff the smoke of his cabin fire. He
opened his eyes. Of course, she wasn&#8217;t Joan, this
strange, gaunt creature. Besides, his wife could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
never have done what this woman was doing.
Why, Joan couldn&#8217;t talk like this, she couldn&#8217;t
act to save her soul! She was as simple as a child,
and shy, with the unself-conscious shyness of
wild things. To be sure, this &#8220;actress-lady&#8221; was
making-believe she was a wild thing, and she was
doing it almighty well, but Joan had been the
reality, and grave and still, part of his own big,
grave, mountain country, not a fierce, man-devouring
animal of the tropics. Pierre lived in
the play with all but one fragment of his brain,
and that remembered Joan. It hurt like a hot
coal, but he deliberately ignored the pain of it.
He followed the action breathlessly, applauded
with contagious fervor, surreptitiously rid himself
of tears, and when, in the last scene, the
angry, jealous woman sprang upon her tamer,
he muttered, &#8220;Serve you right, you coyote!&#8221;
with an oath of the cow-camp that made one of
his neighbors jump and throttle a startled laugh.
</p>
<p>The curtain fell, and while the applause rose
and died down and rose again, and the people
called for &#8220;Jane West! Jane West!&#8221; the stage-director,
a plump little Jew, came out behind the
footlights and held up his hand. There was a
gradual silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to make an interesting announcement,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
he said; &#8220;the author of &#8216;The Leopardess&#8217;
has hitherto maintained his anonymity, but to-night
I have permission to give you his name.
He is in the theater to-night. The name is already
familiar to you as that of the author of a
popular novel, &#8216;The Cañon&#8217;: Prosper Gael.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a stir of interest, a general searching
of the house, clapping, cries of &#8220;Author! Author!&#8221;
and in a few moments Prosper Gael left his box
and appeared beside the director in answer to
the calls. He was entirely self-possessed, looked
even a little bored, but he was very white. He
stood there bowing, a graceful and attractive
figure, and he was about to begin a speech when
he was interrupted by a renewed calling for &#8220;Jane
West!&#8221; The audience wanted to see the star and
the author side by side. Pierre joined in the
clamor.
</p>
<p>After a little pause Jane West came out from
the opposite wing, walking slowly, dressed in her
green gown, jewels on her neck and in her hair.
She did not look toward the audience at all, nor
bow, nor smile, and for some reason the applause
began to falter as though the sensitive
mind of the crowd was already aware that here
something must be wrong. She came very slowly,
her arms hanging, her head bent, her eyes looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
up from under her brows, and she stood beside
Prosper Gael, whose forced smile had stiffened
on his lips. He looked at her in obvious
fear, as a man might look at a dangerous madwoman.
There must have been madness in her
eyes. She stood there for a strange, terrible
moment, moving her head slightly from side to
side. Then she said something in a very low
tone. Because of the extraordinary carrying
quality of her voice&mdash;the question was heard
by every one there present:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> wrote the play? <i>You</i> wrote the play?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said it twice. She seemed to quiver, to
gather herself together, her hands bent, her arms
lifted. She flew at Prosper with all the sudden
strength of her insanity.
</p>
<p>There was an outcry, a confusion. People
rushed to Gael&#8217;s assistance. Men caught hold of
Joan, now struggling frantically. It was a dreadful
sight, mercifully a brief one. She collapsed
utterly, fell forward, the strap of her gown breaking
in the grasp of one of the men who held her.
For an instant every one in the audience saw a
strange double scar that ran across her shoulder
to the edge of the shoulder-blade. It was like two
bars.
</p>
<p>Pierre got to his feet, dropped back, and hid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
his face. Then he was up, and struggling past
excited people down the row, out into the aisle,
along it, hurrying blindly down unknown passages
till somehow he got himself into that confused
labyrinth behind the scenes. Here a pale,
distracted scene-shifter informed him that Miss
West had already been taken home.
</p>
<p>Pierre got the address, found his way out to
the street, hailed a taxicab, and threw himself
into it. He sat forward, every muscle tight; he
felt that he could take the taxicab up and hurl
it forward, so terrible was his impatience.
</p>
<p>An apartment house was a greater novelty to
him even than a theater, but, after a dazed moment
of discovering that he did not have to ring
or knock, but just push open the great iron-scrolled
door and step into the brightly lighted,
steam-heated marble hall, he decided that the
woman at the desk was a person in authority,
and to her he addressed himself, soft hat gripped
in his hand, his face set to hide excitement.
</p>
<p>The girl was pale and red-eyed. They had
brought Miss West in a few minutes ago, she told
him, and carried her up. She was still unconscious;
poor thing! &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could see her, sir.
Mr. Morena is up there, and Mr. Gael, and a
doctor. A trained nurse has been sent for. Everything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
in the world will be done. She&#8217;s such an
elegant actress, ain&#8217;t she? I&#8217;ve often seen her
myself. And so kind and pleasant always. Yes,
sir. I&#8217;ll ask, if you like, but I&#8217;m sure they won&#8217;t
allow you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put the receiver to her ear, pushed in the
black plug, and Pierre listened to her questions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can Miss West see any one? Can an old
friend&#8221;&mdash;for so Pierre had named himself&mdash;&#8220;be
allowed to see her? No. I thought not.&#8221; This,
with a sympathetic glance at Pierre. &#8220;She is not
conscious yet. Dangerously ill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I speak to the doctor?&#8221; Pierre asked
hoarsely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gentleman wants to know if he can
speak to the doctor. Certainly not at present. If
he will wait, the doctor will speak to him on the
way out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre sat on the bench and waited. He leaned
forward, elbows on knees, head crushed in both
hands, and the woman stared at him pitilessly&mdash;not
that he was aware of her scrutiny. His eyes
looked through his surroundings to Joan. He saw
her in every pose and in every look in which he
had ever seen her, and, with a very sick and
frightened heart, he saw her, at the last, pass by
him in her fur coat, throwing him that half-contemptuous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
look and smile. She didn&#8217;t know him.
Was he changed so greatly? Or was the change
in her so enormous that it had disassociated her
completely from her old life, from him? He kept
repeating to himself Holliwell&#8217;s stern, admonishing
speech: &#8220;However changed for the worse she
may be when you do find her, Pierre, you must
remember that it is your fault, your sin. You
must not judge her, must not dare to judge her.
Judge yourself. Condemn yourself. It is for her
to forgive if she can bring herself to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So now Pierre fought down his suspicions and
his fears. He had not recognized Prosper. The
man who had come in out of the white night, four
years ago, had worn his cap low over his eyes,
his collar turned up about his face, and, even at
that, Pierre, in his drunken stupor, had not been
able to see him very clearly. This Prosper Gael
who had stood behind the footlights, this Prosper
Gael at whom Joan, from some unknown cause,
had sprung like a woman maddened by injury,
was a person entirely strange to Pierre. But
Pierre hated him. The man had done Joan some
insufferable mischief, which at the last had driven
her beside herself. Pierre put up a hand, pressing
it against his eyes. He wanted to shut out the
picture of that struggling girl with her torn dress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
and the double scar across her shoulder. If it
hadn&#8217;t been for the scar he would never have
known her&mdash;his Joan, his gentle, silent Joan!
What had they been doing to her to change her
so? No, not they. He. He had changed her. He
had branded her and driven her out. It was his
fault. He must try to find her again, to find the
old Joan&mdash;if she should live. The doctor had
said that she was desperately ill. O God! What
was keeping him so long? Why didn&#8217;t he come?
</p>
<p>The arrival of the trained nurse distracted
Pierre for a few moments. She went past him in
her gray cloak, very quiet and earnest, and the
elevator lifted her out of sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you in the theater to-night?&#8221; asked
the girl at the desk, seeing that he was temporarily
aware of her again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was puzzled by his appearance and the
fashion of his speech. He must be a gentleman,
she thought, for his bearing was gentle and assured
and unself-conscious, but he wore his
clothes differently and spoke differently from
other gentlemen. That &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; especially
disturbed her. Then she remembered a novel she
had read and her mind jumped to a conclusion.
She leaned forward.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, aren&#8217;t you from the West?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t ever a cowboy, were you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre smiled. &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. I was raised in a
cow-camp. I was a cowboy till about seven years
ago when I took to ranchin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in Wyoming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve come straight from there to New
York?&#8221; She pronounced it &#8220;Noo Yoik.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ve been in Alasky for two years
now. I&#8217;ve been in a lumber-camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! That&#8217;s real interesting. And you knew
Miss West before she came East, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; But there was a subtle change
in Pierre&#8217;s patient voice and clear, unhappy eyes,
so that the girl fell to humming and bottled up
her curiosity. But just as soon as he began to
brood again she gave up her whole mind to staring
at him. Gee! He was brown and strong and
thin! And a good-looker! She wished that she had
worn her transformation that evening and her blue
blouse. He might have taken more interest in her.
</p>
<p>A stout, bald-headed man, bag in hand, stepped
out of the elevator, and Pierre rippled to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the doctor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Oh, you&#8217;re the gentleman who wanted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
to see Miss West. She&#8217;s come to, but she is out
of her head completely ... doesn&#8217;t know any
one. Can you step out with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre kept beside him and stood by the motor,
hat still in his hand, while the doctor talked irritably:
&#8220;No. You certainly can&#8217;t see her, for some
time. I shall not allow any one to see her, except
the nurse. It will be a matter of weeks. She&#8217;ll be
lucky if she gets back her sanity at all. She was
entirely out of her head there at the theater.
She&#8217;s worn out, nerves frayed to a frazzle. Horribly
unhealthy life and unnatural. To take a
country girl, an ignorant, untrained, healthy
animal, bring her to the city and force her under
terrific pressure into a life so foreign to her&mdash;well!
it was just a piece of d&mdash;&mdash;d brutality.&#8221;
Then his acute eye suddenly fixed itself on the
man standing on the curb listening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re from the West yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Knew her in the old days&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Pierre&#8217;s voice was faint and he put
a hand against the motor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you take her back with you
to that life? You&#8217;re not feeling any too fit yourself,
are you? Look here. Get in and I&#8217;ll drop you
where you belong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>Pierre obeyed rather blindly and leaned back
with closed eyes. The doctor got out a flask and
poured him a dose of brandy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble? Too much New York?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre shook his head and smiled. &#8220;No, sir.
I&#8217;ve been bothered and didn&#8217;t get round to eating
and sleeping lately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll take you to a restaurant and we&#8217;ll
have supper. I need something myself. And, look
here, I&#8217;ll make you a promise. Just as soon as I
consider her fit for an interview with any one,
I&#8217;ll let you see Miss West. That helps you a
whole lot, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But there were other powers, besides this
friendly one, watching over Joan, and they were
bent upon keeping Pierre away. Day after sickening
day Pierre came and stood beside the desk,
and the girl, each time a little more careless of
him, a little more insolent toward him&mdash;for the
cowboy would not notice her blue blouse and her
transformation and the invitation of her eyes&mdash;gave
him negligent and discouraging information.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss West was better, but very weak. No.
She wouldn&#8217;t see any one. Yes, Mr. Morena
could see her, but not Mr. Landis, certainly not
Mr. Pierre Landis, of Wyoming.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>And the doctor, being questioned by the half-frantic
Westerner, admitted that Mr. Morena
had hinted at reasons why it might be dangerous
for the patient to see her old friend from the
West. Pierre stood to receive this sentence, and
after it, his eyes fell. The doctor had seen the
quick, desperate moisture in them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what, Landis,&#8221; he said, putting a
hand on Pierre&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to take
a risk. I&#8217;m sure of one thing. Miss West hasn&#8217;t
even heard of your inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Morena&#8217;s making it up&mdash;about
her not being willing to see me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do mean that. And no doubt he&#8217;s doing it
with the best intentions. But I&#8217;m willing to take
a risk. See those stairs? You run up them to the
fifth floor. The nurse is out. Gael is in attendance;
that is, he&#8217;s in the sitting-room. She doesn&#8217;t
know of his presence, hasn&#8217;t been allowed to
see him. Miss West&#8217;s door&mdash;the outside one&mdash;is
ajar. Go up. Get past Gael if you can. Behave
yourself quietly, and if you see the least sign of
weakness on the part of Miss West, or if she
shows the slightest disinclination for your company,
come down&mdash;I&#8217;m trusting you&mdash;as
quickly as you can and tell me. I&#8217;ll wait. Have I
your promise?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; gasped Pierre.
</p>
<p>The doctor smiled at the swift, leaping grace
of his Western friend&#8217;s ascent. He was anxious
concerning the result of his experiment, but there
was a memory upon him of a haunted look in
Joan&#8217;s eyes that seemed the fellow to a look of
Pierre&#8217;s. He rather believed in intuitions, especially
his own.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE END OF THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>At the top of the fourth flight of steps, Pierre
found himself facing a door that stood ajar.
Beyond that door was Joan and he knew not
what experience of discovery, of explanation, of
punishment. What he had suffered since the
night of his cruelty would be nothing to what he
might have to suffer now at the hands of the
woman he had loved and hurt. That she was incredibly
changed he knew, what had happened
to change her he did not know. That she had
suffered greatly was certain. One could not look
at the face of Jane West, even under its disguise
of paint and pencil, without a sharp realization
of profound and embittering experience. And,
just as certainly, she had gone far ahead of her
husband in learning, in a certain sort of mental
and social development. Pierre was filled with
doubt and with dread, with an almost unbearable
self-depreciation. And at the same time he
was filled with a nameless fear of what Joan
might herself have become.
</p>
<p>He stood with his hand on the knob of that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
half-opened door, bent his head, and drew some
deep, uneven breaths. He thought of Holliwell
as though the man were standing beside him. He
stepped in quietly, shut the door, and walked
without hesitation down the passageway into
the little, sunny sitting-room. There, before the
crackling, open fire, sat Prosper Gael.
</p>
<p>Prosper, it seemed, was alone in the small,
silent place. He was sitting on the middle of his
spine, as usual, with his long, thin legs stretched
out before him and a veil of cigarette smoke
before his eyes. He turned his head idly, expecting,
no doubt, to see the nurse.
</p>
<p>Pierre, white and grim, stood looking down at
him.
</p>
<p>The older man recognized him at once, but he
did not change his position by a muscle, merely
lounged there, his head against the side of the
cushioned chair, the brilliant, surprised gaze
changing slowly to amused contempt. His cigarette
hung between the long fingers of one hand,
its blue spiral of smoke rising tranquilly into a
bar of sunshine from the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor told me to come up,&#8221; said Pierre
gravely. He was aware of the insult of this
stranger&#8217;s attitude, but he was too deeply stirred,
too deeply suspenseful, to be irritated by it. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
seemed to be moving in some rare, disconnected
atmosphere. &#8220;I have his permission to see&mdash;to
see Miss West, if she is willing to see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper flicked off an ash with his little finger.
&#8220;And you believe that she is willing to see you,
Pierre Landis?&#8221; he asked slowly.
</p>
<p>Pierre gave him a startled look. &#8220;You know
my name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I believe that four years ago, on an especially
cold and snowy night, I interrupted you
in a rather extraordinary occupation and gave
myself the pleasure of shooting you.&#8221; With that
he got to his feet and stood before the mantel,
negligently enough, but ready to his fingertips.
</p>
<p>Pierre came nearer by a stride. He had been
stripped at once of his air of high detachment.
He was pale and quivering. He looked at Prosper
with eyes of incredulous dread.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you&mdash;that man?&#8221; A tide of shamed
scarlet engulfed him and he dropped his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that would take the assurance out
of you,&#8221; said Prosper. &#8220;As a matter of fact,
shooting was too good for you. On that night you
forfeited every claim to the consideration of man
or woman. I have the right of any decent citizen
to turn you out of here. Do you still maintain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
your intention of asking for an interview with
Miss Jane West?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pierre, half-blind with humiliation, turned
without a word and made his way to the door.
He meant to go away and kill himself. The purpose
was like iron in his mind. That he should
have to stand and, because of his own cowardly
fault, to endure insult from this contemptuous
stranger, made of life a garment too stained, too
shameful to be worn. He was in haste to be rid
of it. Something, however, barred his exit. He
stumbled back to avoid it. There, holding aside
the curtain in the doorway, stood Joan.
</p>
<p>This time there was no possible doubt of her
identity. She was wrapped in a long, blue gown,
her hair had fallen in braided loops on either side
of her face and neck. The unchanged eyes of Joan
under her broad brows looked up at him. She was
thin and wan, unbelievably broken and tired and
hurt, but she was Joan. Pierre could not but forget
death at sight of her. He staggered forward,
and she, putting up her arms, drew him hungrily
and let fall her head upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My gel! My Joan!&#8221; Pierre sobbed.
</p>
<p>Prosper&#8217;s voice sawed into their tremulous
silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, after all, the branding iron is the proper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
instrument,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A man can always recognize
his estray, and when she is recognized she
will come to heel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan pushed Pierre from her violently and
turned upon Prosper Gael. Her voice broke over
him in a tumult of soft scorn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know nothing of loving, Prosper Gael,
not the first letter of loving. Nobody has learned
that about you as well as I have. Now, listen and
I will teach you something. This is something
that <i>I</i> have learned. There are worse wounds
than I had from Pierre, and it is by the hands of
such men as you are that they are given. The
hurts you get from love, they heal. Pierre was
mad, he was a beast, he branded me as though
I had been a beast. For long years I couldn&#8217;t
think of him but with a sort of horror in my heart.
If it hadn&#8217;t been for you, I might never have
thought of him no other way forever. But what
you did to me, Prosper, you with your white-hot
brain and your gray-cold heart, you with your
music and your talk throbbing and talking and
whining about my soul, what you did to me has
made Pierre&#8217;s iron a very gentle thing. I have
not acted in the play you wrote, the play you
made out of me and my unhappiness, without
understanding just what it was that you did to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
me. Perhaps if it hadn&#8217;t been for the play, I
might even have believed that you were capable
of something better than that passion you had
once for me&mdash;but not now. Never now can I
believe it. What you make other people suffer
is material for your own success and you delight
in it. You make notes upon it. Pierre was mad
through loving me, too ignorantly, too jealously,
but what you did to me was through loving me
too little. That was a brand upon my brain and
soul. Sometimes since then that scar on my shoulder
has seemed to me almost like the memory of
a caress. I went away from Pierre, leaving him
for dead, ready for death myself. When you left
me, you left me alive and ready for what sort of
living? It has been Pierre&#8217;s love and his following
after me that have kept me from low and beastly
things. I&#8217;ve run from him knowing I wasn&#8217;t fit
to be found by him, but I&#8217;ve run clean and free.&#8221;
She began to tremble. &#8220;Will you say anything
more to me and to my man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper&#8217;s face wore its old look of the winged
demon. He was cold in his angry pain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one thing to your man, perhaps, if you
will allow me, but perhaps you&#8217;ll tell him that
yourself. That his method is the right one, I admit.
But in one respect not even a brand will altogether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
preserve property rights. Morena could
say something on that score. So could I....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Joan; &#8220;I will tell him myself.
Pierre, I left you for dead and I went away with
this man, and after a while, because I thought
you were dead, and because I was alone and sorrowful
and weak, and because, perhaps, of what
my mother was, I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; She fell away from
Pierre, crouched against the side of the door, and
wrapped the curtain round her face. &#8220;He told
me you were dead&mdash;&#8221; The words came muffled.
</p>
<p>Pierre had let her go and turned to Prosper.
His own face was a mask of rage. Prosper knew
that it was the Westerner&#8217;s intention to kill. For
a minute, no longer, he was a lightning channel
of death. But Pierre, the Pierre shaped during
the last four difficult years, turned upon his own
writhing, savage soul and forced it to submit. It
was as though he fought with his hands. Sweat
broke out on him. At last, he stood and looked at
Prosper with sane, stern eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s true what you hinted, if that&#8217;s true
what she was tryin&#8217; to tell, if it&#8217;s even partly
true,&#8221; he said painfully, &#8220;then it was me that
brought it upon her, not you&mdash;an&#8217; not herself,
but me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned back to Joan, drew the curtain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
from her face, drew down her hands, lifted her
and carried her to the couch beside the fire.
</p>
<p>There she shrank away from him, tried to
push him back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, Pierre; not that about Morena, but
the rest is true. It&#8217;s true. Only he told me you
were dead. But you weren&#8217;t&mdash;no, don&#8217;t take
my hands, I never did have dealings with Holliwell.
Indeed, I loved only you. But you must
have known me better than I knew myself. For
I am bad. I am bad. I left you for dead and I
went away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had mastered her hands, both of them in
one of his, and he drew them close to his heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Joan! Hush, Joan! You mustn&#8217;t. It
was my doings, gel, all of it. Hush!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bent and crushed his lips against hers,
silencing her. Then she gave way and clung to
him, sobbing.
</p>
<p>After a while Pierre looked up at Prosper Gael.
All the patience and the hunger and the beauty
of his love possessed his face. There was simply
no room in his heart for any lesser thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; he said in the grave and gentle
Western speech, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask you to leave
me with my wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prosper made a curious, silent gesture of self-despair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
and went out, feeling his way before
him.
</p>
<p>It was half an hour later when the doctor came
softly to the door and held back the curtain in
his hand. He did not say anything and, after a
silent minute, he let fall the curtain and moved
softly away. He was reassured as to the success
of his experiment. He had seen Joan&#8217;s face.
